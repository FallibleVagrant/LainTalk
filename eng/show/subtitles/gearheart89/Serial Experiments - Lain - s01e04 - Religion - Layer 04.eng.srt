1
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:13,989
I don't need parents.
Humans are all alone.

2
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,096
They're not connected
to anyone at all.

3
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,828
How did it go?

4
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:08,740
Lain's acting funny.

5
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:11,439
It's nothing new, but still...

6
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:14,514
No, it's perfectly normal.

7
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,412
Huh? What're you talking about?

8
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:22,078
Mika, watch your tone
with your father.

9
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,893
Is she right?

10
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,961
Yes.

11
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,940
Shit! Shit!

12
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,015
Shit!

13
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:40,930
Shit! Shit!

14
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,139
What do you want?!

15
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:57,944
What's going on?!

16
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:59,551
Shit!

17
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:02,381
SHIT!

18
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:16,995
Gotcha.

19
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:33,851
We have homeroom next hour, right?
Is that lucky, or what?

20
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:37,317
Don't you think it's strange that
they called a special staff meeting?

21
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:40,656
Do you think it's true, then?

22
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,758
What?

23
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,258
They say a high school
senior committed suicide.

24
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:49,532
S-Suicide?

25
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:51,896
It's not just at our school, either.

26
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:55,569
Somebody jumped off the roof of their
apartment building a while ago, too.

27
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:57,106
Hey, Lain.

28
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,375
Sorry. What is it?

29
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:12,991
I guess Lain wouldn't
know anything about it...

30
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:14,322
The suicide, you mean?

31
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,954
You know about that?

32
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,330
Really?

33
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:20,896
I've just heard a little
about it, that's all.

34
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:22,664
Where?

35
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:25,496
The Wired.

36
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:29,501
Right, you must've gotten the
hang of your new Navi by now.

37
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,340
You'll have to show
it to me sometime.

38
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:35,211
Sure. But I'm modifying
it a little right now.

39
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:39,150
Modifying it? I didn't know
you were into that hacky stuff.

40
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:43,682
You know, you've changed lately.

41
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:46,824
Really? You think so?

42
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:50,359
She has?

43
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,832
Yeah. I can't put my finger on it.

44
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,706
So, what sort of rumors have
you heard in the Wired?

45
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:03,139
Well... That's it's
some kind of game.

46
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:06,407
A game? A network game, you mean?

47
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,616
I don't really know.
I don't play those.

48
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,750
But they say that all the dead
kids were hooked on it.

49
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:17,651
Guys sure like that stuff...

50
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,088
A game, huh? But why?

51
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:23,228
<i>I...</i>

52
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:28,434
Hey, don't wolf down food
like that! You'll choke!

53
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:30,632
<i>I'm okay.</i>

54
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,036
You mind if I go home'?

55
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:35,939
Hey, you don't need to ask
our permission or anything.

56
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:37,373
You have plans?

57
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:40,070
I want to get home and put
my Navi back together.

58
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,046
It's still in bits and pieces.

59
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:44,883
You prefer a machine
to your friends, huh?

60
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,545
Cut it out, Juri!
Don't talk like that!

61
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:50,687
I'm not accusing her of anything.

62
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,554
Once you're done, you'll
have to show us, Lain.

63
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,164
Sure.

64
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:00,501
Sorry.

65
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,570
She has changed.

66
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:13,240
I'm sorry!

67
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,247
Here.

68
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:19,751
No, it was my fault.

69
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:24,054
Sorry!

70
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:41,606
Log in. Lain.

71
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:43,601
Authorized.

72
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:45,204
Mail.

73
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:53,845
Voice mail.

74
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:57,046
Hello, Lain.

75
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:01,356
I couldn't figure out the answer
to your question by myself,

76
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,956
so I asked a colleague
at the lab about it.

77
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:09,094
If that really is a Psyche
processor that you have,

78
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:15,165
then you should probably set the
oscillation to "variable" like you thought.

79
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:20,781
Navi motherboards are designed
to work with just about anything,

80
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:23,142
but you might run
into some glitches.

81
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,318
Good luck.

82
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:28,284
If you need anything
else, just ask.

83
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:49,667
JJ!

84
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:50,734
Yeah?

85
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:53,474
You know anything about that net
game that all the kids are playing?

86
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:56,549
Oh, you mean Phantoma?

87
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:00,850
Forget about it. An adult like
you wouldn't be into that.

88
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:04,522
Right, Lain?

89
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:07,186
No way...

90
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:11,187
Damn, are my ears playing
tricks on me already?

91
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:48,729
I... I quit already!

92
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,569
Leave me out of it!

93
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:52,158
This isn't the Wired!

94
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:54,995
Why? Why is this happening?!

95
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,171
Wait, don't run.

96
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,604
Who are you?!

97
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:12,149
Are you a PK, too? Help me!

98
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,521
I can't go where you are.

99
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,756
What's going on?!

100
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:32,361
Stop screwing around!

101
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:49,585
Bullet charge! Gauge 5!

102
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,222
Die!

103
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,095
Die!

104
00:13:58,187 --> 00:13:59,097
Die!

105
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:00,565
Die!

106
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:01,429
Die!

107
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:02,331
Die!

108
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:02,993
Die!

109
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,038
Die!

110
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:09,970
Die!

111
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:10,770
Die!

112
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,605
Die!

113
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,338
Die!

114
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:14,139
Die!

115
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,041
Die!

116
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:26,546
I was scared, that's all.

117
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:33,618
I didn't know it was just a
little girl. It's not my fault.

118
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,928
I didn't even know her.

119
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:42,668
Phantoma is a game with a
dedicated client application...

120
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:46,762
...that lets you fight in the Wired.

121
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:53,406
I downloaded the app from an illegal
server to play it a little while ago.

122
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:59,951
For us, it had a dungeon-style
action game interface,

123
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,547
but I guess it had
somehow gotten linked...

124
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,651
to a tag game played
by kindergartners.

125
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:17,064
You have mail.

126
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,898
Open it.

127
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:24,574
Hey, Lain. I didn't know you
were into stuff like Phantoma.

128
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,716
I checked around, but
didn't find out much.

129
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:35,021
Anyway, the basic game isn't
all that unusual in the Wired,

130
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,018
so my guess is that
they just modified that.

131
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:42,826
The problem is the part that lets
the programs connect to each other.

132
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,728
It looks like there's some kind
of weird hole in the protocol.

133
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:51,129
My buddies and I think that this
may be the work of the Knights, too.

134
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:01,079
Knights...

135
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:02,340
Lain?

136
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:08,752
Looks like you and the Wired are
getting along just fine now.

137
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:10,713
Yeah.

138
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:14,453
Let me give you one little warning.

139
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:15,661
Huh?

140
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,957
When it's all said and
done, the Wired...

141
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:23,931
...is just a medium for communication
and the transfer of information.

142
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,667
You mustn't confuse it
with the real world.

143
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,671
Do you understand what
I'm warning you about?

144
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:39,252
You're wrong.

145
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:41,353
Huh?

146
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:47,121
The border between the
two isn't all that clear.

147
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:55,565
I'll be able to enter it soon.

148
00:17:55,724 --> 00:18:00,696
In full range. Full motion.
I'll translate myself into it.

149
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:05,606
Even with a top of the line
civilian Navi, you couldn't...

150
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:09,610
I can do it. I've modified mine.

151
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:13,018
A Psyche processor, huh?

152
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,084
But...

153
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:18,786
Don't worry. I'm still me.

154
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:21,523
Sometimes I wonder.

155
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,747
I waited for you for hours!

156
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:54,750
Why? Why didn't you come?!

157
00:18:58,353 --> 00:19:03,564
Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!

158
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:05,333
Damn you!

159
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,102
This mail is a
message of happiness!

160
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:16,506
By receiving this, you'll be
happier than anyone else!

161
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:22,521
In other words, the Knights
do not physically exist,

162
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:26,216
but are rather thought itself
that occurs within the Wired.

163
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:31,427
They can be thought of as a religion
that is spreading through the Wired.

164
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,165
Would you go out with me?

165
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:37,202
If you already have a
boyfriend, I apologize.

166
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,767
If you love him, I'll
give up on you. But if...

167
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:50,582
Please browse code
J946@5488AA97464.

168
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:57,019
Whoever gets this mail, please
help me, whoever you are.

169
00:19:57,312 --> 00:20:02,421
You may not believe this,
but I'm always being followed.

170
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:12,437
Lain, why won't you come here?

171
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:05,716
Go away.

172
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:17,601
Go away!

173
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:45,927
Intruder interrupted.

174
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:40,543
I thought I was innocent,
but I'm being punished.

175
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:45,809
I didn't start this, but I
have to finish it somehow.

176
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:08,840
I can't say I didn't know about it,
but I don't remember taking part in it.

177
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:15,311
I get the feeling <i>my</i>
freedom cost me dearly,

178
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:22,590
but I don't remember
selling my soul cheaply.

179
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:23,962
Hey, hey!

180
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:30,425
Until I die and say goodbye...

181
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:32,966
Hey, hey!

182
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:40,344
...no one will ever catch me.

183
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:48,179
You probably don't know
the eternal outlaws...

184
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:53,586
...who wander the distant night.
