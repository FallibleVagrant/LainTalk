1
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,300
Do you want to be hurt, too?

2
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,236
Do you want your heart to feel like
it's being scraped with a rasp?

3
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,817
If you do, don't look away,
whatever you do.

4
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,201
<i>Nobody knows if there is or not.</i>

5
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:47,968
<i>It doesn't matter to the user
if God exists in the Wired.</i>

6
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,379
<i>just a second, Lain.</i>

7
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,941
<i>Let me take out this guy first.</i>

8
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:59,622
What's so fun about this?
All you do is kill other players.

9
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,895
Nobody knows <i>what's</i> fun and <i>why.</i>

10
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,865
"Tachibana General Laboratories"
was written on the door plate.

11
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,581
A company as big as Tachibana General
Labs wouldn't do anything illegal.

12
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,351
I've heard some rumors, though...

13
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,289
Rumors?

14
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:39,686
Do you know how we're able to exchange
information in the Wired like this?

15
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,624
Oh, so you're testing me, huh?

16
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,860
You're talking about the IP.

17
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,034
Sorry. You're right.

18
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,041
We aren't usually aware of
the protocol's existence.

19
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,947
But the current 6th-gen protocol has
reached its data throughput limit.

20
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,509
The 7th-gen protocol...

21
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,181
Yes. The 7th-gen protocol.

22
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,650
Big companies are the ones that're
making it into the new infrastructure.

23
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:15,361
To control the protocol is to
control the economy of the Wired.

24
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,501
I hear there's constant
sabotage attempts going on.

25
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,038
And the party behind it is...

26
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,366
Tachibana General Labs.

27
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,763
Sis?

28
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,566
Mom? Dad?

29
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,638
I...-

30
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,746
A while ago, somebody
asked me something.

31
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:19,347
"Are you Lain lwakura? Are your
parents really your parents?”

32
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,060
Isn't that funny?

33
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,225
It's funny, isn't it?

34
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,590
People say the funniest things, huh?

35
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,531
Right?

36
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,641
- Good morning!
- 'Morning!

37
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,988
Arisu...

38
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,687
Good morning.

39
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,821
W-What's wrong?

40
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,968
I don't believe it, but...

41
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,698
W-What?

42
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,570
Lain... You didn't do it, right?

43
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,809
D-Didn't do what?

44
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,475
She's just playing innocent!

45
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,877
Reika! You don't know that!

46
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,746
Lain, seriously... It wasn't you?

47
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,221
What... are you talking about?

48
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,862
Lain, in the Wired, did you...

49
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,470
No, forget about it.
It couldn't have been you, Lain.

50
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,005
I trust you. Okay?

51
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,276
Arisu...!

52
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,833
Arisu!

53
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,678
It's too dangerous. Avoid
approving any more bills.

54
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:35,782
I can't believe it! How can such a
nice guy be into such weird stuff?

55
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,754
There's an extremely
serious bug in Protocol 6.

56
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,916
Damage caused by this may prove
disastrous in the Wired...

57
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,155
Every night, a small,
child-like person in a...

58
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,357
red and green striped
sweater appears in her room...

59
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,595
When she was in high school,
that pop singer hit someone...

60
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,192
...with her boyfriend's
car and fled the scene!

61
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,467
It's gotta be true!
I heard it firsthand!

62
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,131
That building's a
famous haunted spot.

63
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,644
If you look at a terminal at night,

64
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,146
internal e-mail shows up,
but there's nobody there!

65
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,979
The Knights don't exist! Some American
students started it as a joke!

66
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,679
Shut up! Who cares
about any of that?

67
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,317
Don't you find it interesting?

68
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,153
Who's there?

69
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,658
You're looking for me, aren't you?

70
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,465
So God makes His
grand entrance, huh?

71
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,095
How do you define "God"?

72
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,464
If it's the creator of the
world, that's not me.

73
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:33,734
The all-powerful ruler of the world?
You give God too much credit.

74
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,711
Where are you?

75
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:41,641
But if you define God as one who
exists everywhere in that other world?

76
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:46,552
If that's what you mean, then yes.
I suppose you could call me that.

77
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,420
I have only a slight influence on
the workings of the world, however.

78
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,329
Who the hell are you?!

79
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,255
I am you.

80
00:10:54,286 --> 00:11:00,635
You must have realized that another
you has always existed in the Wired.

81
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,069
You are merely a hologram
of that other you.

82
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,469
You are just a body.

83
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,674
You... expect me to believe that?

84
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,749
That's impossible. It's crazy.

85
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,915
But you don't think that the
you in the real world...

86
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:23,125
...is the same as the one standing
here in the Wired, do you?

87
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,789
But I'm me...

88
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:08,496
Peeping Tom

89
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,588
Arisu?

90
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,399
Arisu? Where are you?

91
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,198
Arisu?

92
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:14,596
Arisu!

93
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,163
Arisu! Where are you?

94
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,902
Arisu!

95
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,240
Arisu, where are you? Arisu!

96
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,144
What did I do?

97
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,817
What did I do in the Wired?

98
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,183
What's the other me doing?

99
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,882
Is it all right for you to
do this with a teacher?

100
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,656
N-No, it's not...

101
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,791
Why do it, then?

102
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,658
Because... I want to.

103
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:23,195
"Hey, do you know who
Arisu Mizuki likes?"

104
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:30,935
"Do you know who she's thinking
of when she plays with herself?"

105
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,543
It was you who told everyone!
The rumors were true?!

106
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,144
Lain!

107
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,217
You've always been sitting
there quietly, watching me?!

108
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:51,319
You saw what I didn't want anybody to
know! When I didn't want anybody to see!

109
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,854
And when I...

110
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,660
Tell me it isn't true, Lain!

111
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,330
Lain!

112
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,831
You...

113
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,486
Who are you?

114
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,249
You're not me.

115
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,393
I'd never do what you do.

116
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,296
I...

117
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:05,393
Stop it! Why are you acting like
the part of me that I hate?

118
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,943
You...

119
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,207
I'm committing suicide!

120
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,781
Why? Why are you warm?

121
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:32,692
Why do I have to feel
your body heat?

122
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,589
Hey, I'm Lain, aren't I?

123
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,956
No!

124
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,295
No!

125
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,786
What are these things?

126
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,360
They're all you.

127
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,959
I said that you've always existed
in the Wired, didn't I?

128
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,692
You're the same as me.

129
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,028
You're omnipresent in the Wired.

130
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:18,804
Wherever anyone is, wherever they go,
you have always been there.

131
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:23,445
You've watched what they
didn't want others to see.

132
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,948
You've told everyone
about it, that's all.

133
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,916
It was the right thing to do.

134
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:33,252
The Wired's information should
be shared, shouldn't it?

135
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,064
Everything you say is a lie.

136
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,235
Why is that?

137
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:52,265
Arisu and the others said that they
saw me in the Wired when I wasn't there.

138
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,511
As long as I'm aware of myself...

139
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,279
...my true self is inside of me!

140
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,846
You're telling me that
these dupes are me?

141
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,184
What a load of garbage!

142
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,984
I...

143
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,059
lf l'm really what
you say I am, then...

144
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,727
Then what, Lain?

145
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:23,673
Their memories of being seen by Lain...
I could delete that information!

146
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,110
That's true. Give it a try.

147
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,148
You were born with
that kind of power.

148
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,965
- Good morning!
- 'Morning!

149
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,347
Lain!

150
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,610
Hey, Lain!

151
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,316
<i>They forgot?</i>

152
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,460
<i>They really forgot?</i>

153
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,327
Lain!

154
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,464
<i>They did!</i>

155
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,531
Arisu!

156
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,734
W-What?

157
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,238
Arisu!

158
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,342
Hey, I wanna go to Cyberia today!

159
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:41,976
Cmon, let's go!

160
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:43,709
I second that!

161
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,813
Wow, this sure is unusual...

162
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,858
Sure. We can get changed at my
place again and go from there.

00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:49,789
Great!

164
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,190
Hey, what should I wear?

165
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,631
Stop it! <i>I'm</i> me!

166
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,341
I'm over here!

167
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,906
- Come on, hurry up!
- Hey, wait for me!

168
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:21,823
That's right!
Lain is Lain, and I'm me.

169
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,205
Hello, Navi.

170
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,076
Hello, Lain.

171
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,419
I... I'm me, right?

172
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,930
There's no other me but me, right?
