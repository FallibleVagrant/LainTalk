1
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,227
I wish you'd come here...

2
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,355
You'll have to excuse me.
All this talking has worn me out.

3
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,200
I've never seen one before!

4
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:42,102
Lain Iwakura. Are you and the Lain
of the Wired one and the same?

5
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:47,206
I've seen you before. In the Wired.

6
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,168
Poor Lain...

7
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,317
Hey, I'm Lain, aren't I?

8
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,549
No!

9
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,058
No, you're not!

10
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:25,099
That's right, Lain. You're not
needed in the real world.

11
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,073
I'm committing suicide!

12
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,678
Why? Why are you warm?

13
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:39,484
Why do I have to feel the
heat from your body?

14
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,390
Yes. I'm God.

15
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,558
How could you...?

16
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,345
Lain,you'd have more fun if
you were a little more sociable.

17
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,797
She's changed, all right.

18
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,404
Are you okay?

19
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,872
Lately... You've been slipping
back to your old self, Lain.

20
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,316
Are you okay? Lain, I...

21
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:23,891
Lain, I'm sorry! it's all
our fault! Are you okay, Lain?

22
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,301
Glad to hear it.

23
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,657
Are you tired?

24
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,527
Yes.

25
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,895
You're incredible...

26
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:42,531
So, you've loaded an emulator of
that Navi into your own brain.

27
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,100
It's dangerous to subject yourself to
that much information all at once.

28
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,511
At your current capacity,
you'll overflow.

29
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,110
Am I a machine?

30
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:05,261
Don't talk about me
like I'm a machine.

31
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,288
I didn't mean to.

32
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,769
This is basically a software problem.

33
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,373
Lain, you're software.

34
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,905
You're not hardware.

35
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,310
Software...?

36
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:28,682
Yes. An executable
program with a body.

37
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,272
Be quiet...

38
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,280
<i>Be quiet!</i>

39
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,413
Chisa...!

40
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:44,392
Chisa, we walked home
together just once, right?

41
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:52,325
I understand. I finally
understand what you told me.

42
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,497
Lain...

43
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,381
It's easy to die, Lain.

44
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,082
Right?

45
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,906
There's nothing easy about dying.

46
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,710
Sure it is!

47
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:44,885
Lain, you already have a tool
that will let you do it.

48
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,620
What do you-

49
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,591
The safety's already off.

50
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:01,698
The trigger's heavy, so hold it with
both hands and pull it with your thumb.

51
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,502
A girl isn't strong enough.

52
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,647
What, you still want to
stay in the real world?

53
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,780
Hey, that's not fair.
You called me here, remember?

54
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,154
I... I never...

55
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,480
Bodies are meaningless.

56
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,086
You're wrong.

57
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,288
Lain.

58
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,762
What is this?

59
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:44,406
<i>I thought that maybe we could meet
after school and I could introduce you.</i>

60
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,315
<i>This guy's pretty cute!</i>

61
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,855
<i>And then those rumors about
you and that teacher...</i>

62
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:57,156
<i>I think if you get a boyfriend,
everyone will know they're a lie.</i>

63
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,792
<i>See you tomorrow.
We'll talk about it then.</i>

64
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,022
<i>'Bye!</i>

65
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,038
<i>It's not a lie.</i>

66
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,785
W-Who's there?

67
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,989
Who's there?!

68
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,739
Lain...?

69
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,070
W-What?

70
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,647
What's happened to you...? You...

71
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,689
It wasn't me.

72
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:07,330
I never peeked at
your secrets, Arisu,

73
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:12,228
and I never sent those
secrets out onto the Wired.

74
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:18,067
It was you, Lain! I saw you!

75
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,710
That isn't me.

76
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:25,806
It looks like I'm not the only
me. Some other me did it.

77
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,814
What're you talking about?

78
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,752
You might not be the
only Arisu, either.

79
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:41,087
But no matter how often I say I didn't
do it, you'll believe that I <i>did</i>

80
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,532
So I'll make it so that
it never happened.

81
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,268
I've been working really hard
to be able to do that.

82
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,542
What do you mean?

83
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,875
I don't need devices anymore.

84
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,144
It looks like I've already
destroyed the border...

85
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,809
between the Wired and the real world.

86
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,754
I can go anyplace I want to now.

87
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,980
Sol came here.

88
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:13,189
I should be able to <i>undo</i>
something that happened!

89
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,429
Lain...

90
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,045
I...-

91
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,011
I'm scared...

92
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,944
I'm scared...!

93
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,965
Arisu!

94
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,802
Arisu! Good morning!

95
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,040
Good morning.

96
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,479
What's up, Arisu?
Why are you depressed?

97
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,915
Oh, is it that time of the month?

98
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,282
Hey, you ever hear of "delicacy"?

99
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,844
Come on, I was only...

100
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:16,749
Juri... I don't think I can
go through with it today.

101
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,894
Huh? Go through with what?

102
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,291
What? Didn't you send
me a CU-mail yesterday?

103
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,634
No, I didn't send you
anything yesterday...

104
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,363
You're sure acting
strange today, Arisu.

105
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,810
Arisu!

106
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,583
Oh, that teacher... He sure is hot!

107
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:45,783
Yeah! But rumor has it that
he's seeing an 8th-grader!

108
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,724
What, are you serious?
That's gross!

109
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,761
Um... Listen, I...

110
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,423
What is it?

111
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,328
A-About that teacher... and me...

112
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,470
ls there something between
that teacher and you?

113
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,101
Do you like him or something?

114
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,242
Sorry, you're too late!

115
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,645
Yeah! He already has a girlfriend.

116
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,642
That's not like you, Arisu.

117
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,378
Yeah, she sure is
acting strange today.

118
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,110
Lain! Good morning!

119
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,918
Hurry it UP!

120
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,251
Come on, Lain!

121
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:53,746
Lain!

122
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,356
Lain, you...

123
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:12,868
Lain,you smiled...

124
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:39,658
I thought I was innocent,
but I'm being punished.

125
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:44,958
I didn't start this, but I
have to finish it somehow.

126
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:07,990
I can't say I didn't know about it,
but I don't remember taking part in it.

127
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:14,427
I get the feeling my
freedom cost me dearly,

128
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:21,739
but I don't remember
selling my soul cheaply.

129
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,112
Hey. hey!

130
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:29,552
Until I die and say goodbye...

131
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,082
Hey. hey!

132
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:39,494
...no one can catch me.

133
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:47,328
You probably don't know
the eternal outlaws...

134
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:52,735
...who wander the distant night.
