1
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,389
If you want to be free of suffering,
you should believe in God.

2
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:20,357
Whether or not you believe in Him,
God is always by your side.

3
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:47,695
On July 4, 1947, a strange craft crashed
in the desert in New Mexico, America.

4
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:55,992
What it was has yet to be proven.

5
00:02:56,025 --> 00:03:01,134
Conjecture has become fact,
and rumor has become history.

6
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,625
Who's there?

7
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:06,965
In 1984, a manila envelope arrived at
the home of TV producer Jaime Shandera.

8
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,269
The envelope, from an anonymous source,
contained a roll of undeveloped film.

9
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:19,036
The film contained what is
called the MJ-12 Document.

10
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:28,678
Roscoe Hillenkoetter, head of the CIA
at the time of the Roswell Incident,

11
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:30,713
was at the top of the
list of 12 members.

12
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,695
It stated that these men concluded a
secret treaty with extraterrestrials...

13
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:38,563
...as a special organization
answerable only to the president.

14
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,967
It is now accepted that President
Truman's signature on the document...

15
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:48,373
...was in fact copied carefully
from another document.

16
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,148
Named as a member of
MJ-12 was Vannevar Bush,

17
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:59,483
head of MIT's Department
of Electrical Engineering.

18
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:10,327
Connect to Wired.

19
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:34,686
How could I turn something that <i>did</i>
happen into something that <i>didn't</i>?

20
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,482
Are you Lain? I see, I see...

21
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:41,987
I don't know you.

22
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:45,598
But you know <i>me...</i>

23
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:50,367
The flow of information
doesn't always go both ways.

24
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:55,665
Since the moment of the Wired's
creation, you have always been here.

25
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,142
Here, you are free.

26
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:02,307
I'm trying to tell you
that that's not me!

27
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:03,778
I suppose.

28
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:07,616
How long have we been here, then?

29
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:12,951
At the very least, we cannot have been
here since this world was created.

30
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:15,023
That has nothing to do with it!

31
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:20,696
If a being is remembered, that
proves that it's part of a record!

32
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,596
That's preposterous.

33
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,968
How old do you think this " Lain”
girl is? She's still a child!

34
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:31,639
Let's not worry about
me now, okay? I--

35
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:54,726
The MEMEX memory expansion concept
unveiled by Vannevar Bush in 1945...

36
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:57,533
...was a system whereby information
recorded on microfilm...

37
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,904
...was projected onto
a translucent screen.

38
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:07,107
What he envisioned was the compression
and rapid access of information.

39
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:10,208
Even before the advent of computers,

40
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,018
Bush had already created the basis
for our current multimedia...

41
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:19,159
...while he led the Manhattan
Project atom bomb experiments.

42
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,379
You forgot this.

43
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:49,012
You forgot this on the
floor here yesterday.

44
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,448
If you don't need it, I'll toss it.

45
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:55,017
I left that here?

46
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,360
That's what I'm sayin'.

47
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,684
Conducting sensory deprivation
experiments using...

48
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:23,681
Native American narcotics and isolation
tanks to probe the human unconscious,

49
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:29,294
john C. Lilly believed his experiments
connected him to cosmic entities...

50
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,355
...by way of a
communication network.

51
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:36,961
Lilly dubbed the beings
that guided him E.C.C.O.,

52
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,735
Earth Coincidence Control Office.

53
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,812
Afterwards, Lilly began work on
communication with dolphins.

54
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:56,648
Dolphins are creatures which
are able to conduct...

55
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,957
...wide-range networking in the
water via ultrasonic waves.

56
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:17,876
<i>What?</i>

57
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:23,511
You promised me earlier.

58
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:26,215
Promised what?

59
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:28,278
That you'd go out with me.

60
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,790
You said you'd go out with me!

61
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:34,057
W-What're you talking about?

62
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:36,496
Taro, is that true?

63
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:39,733
Did I?

64
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,726
You didn't! You didn't!

65
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:48,465
Even if I did, you aren't the you
I want to go out with right now, Lain.

66
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:50,309
Taro, you moron!

67
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,880
We're the same. I'm me.
I'm the only me.

68
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,671
Awesome!

69
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:24,007
I can't believe you put together
something like this!

70
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:28,373
Oh, okay...! This syncs up
the parallel processors!

71
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:33,317
It's not pretty, but you can
keep on expanding it this way.

72
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,822
What're you using as coolant?

73
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:37,655
Taro...

74
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,682
Is this liquid carbon?

75
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:41,092
Sit down over there.

76
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,889
Damn...

77
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:53,234
I think you know what this is.

78
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:58,170
It's you, isn't it, Taro?

79
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:03,714
You're with the Knights, aren't you?

80
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,560
You're... the real Lain.

81
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:20,801
I don't know whether or not
there's another me in the Wired.

82
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:26,630
But there's definitely no other
me here in the real world.

83
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:33,208
The other one with a body has
only appeared in the club.

84
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,943
You only need to manipulate the
memories of the people there, right?

85
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,748
I... I can't...

86
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,032
Play track 44.

87
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:08,111
It's almost over, isn't it?

88
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:12,551
Finally.

89
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:17,456
So while we still can, we should...

90
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:45,808
Roger.

91
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:50,779
Now communicating.

92
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,375
Stop.

93
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:14,976
It's not me!

94
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:22,013
But I knew the data coming into
JJ's place had this kind of effect.

95
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:28,795
If I had installed this chip,
what would've happened to me?

96
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,930
Would I have killed myself?
Gone insane?

97
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:34,534
I said I don't know!

98
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:38,102
There's no way a kid like me could
be a formal Knights member!

99
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:40,037
I'm just a-

100
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:41,741
I wonder what this will do?

101
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:50,644
I-It's non-volatile memory! It'll overwrite existing memories!

102
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,416
What kind of memories?

103
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:55,585
I-I don't know.

104
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,593
The Knights aren’t just
ordinary crackers, Lain.

105
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:18,411
There's something strange
about you. That's for sure.

106
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,110
That's why the Knights
are so interested.

107
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:24,914
The Knights are users
who are fighting...

108
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,546
...to make the only truth
there is into a reality.

109
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:34,624
I don't understand.
What do you mean, "one truth"?

110
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,789
Like I said, I'm not a
formal Knights member.

111
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:40,092
They never explained it to me.

112
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:45,762
But it's true. The truth has
power <i>because</i> it's the truth.

113
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:49,071
And because it's the truth,
that makes it just.

114
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:53,679
It's persuasive, isn't it?
Don't you want truth like that?

115
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,816
I'm going.

116
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:03,421
Myu-Myu is jealous of you.

117
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,225
Taro...? Thank you.

118
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:11,491
You...

119
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,514
Hey, this is a date, you know?
I'm a guy. I had to do that.

120
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,588
Ted Nelson, who studied under
the two cult pioneers...

121
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,863
...Vannevar Bush and John C. Lilly,

122
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,839
proposed a giant electronic library
in satellites in stationary orbit...

123
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:58,669
...which could be used at any terminal
on Earth via radio or phone lines.

124
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:04,344
He called this concept that would
make this database "Xanadu."

125
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:13,988
The Mongolian utopia where all written
cultures would never be lost.

126
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,726
This was Xanadu.

127
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:22,659
It was the concept of Hypertext
that would make it real,

128
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:28,032
and Ted Nelson's name would go
down in history as its originator.

129
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:37,882
Hello, Navi.

130
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:46,258
Click, click... Memory check...

131
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:48,455
Click, click...

132
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,363
Click, click...

133
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:43,612
That's... That's me?

134
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,546
Yes. This is me.

135
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:51,215
Then who are they?

136
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,984
I'm you, so I wouldn't know.

137
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,623
This is a lie.

138
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,038
It's a lie. it's all a lie.

139
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:08,605
Why are you doing this?

140
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:14,438
The Earth has its own specific
electromagnetic waves.

141
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:17,613
Between the ionosphere
and the Earth's surface,

142
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:22,816
...there is a constant resonance at
a frequency of 8Hz in the ELF band.

143
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:25,918
This is called the
Schumann Resonance.

144
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:36,830
The extent of the effect on humans
of these "Earth Brain Waves"...

145
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:42,098
...that the planet constantly
gives off remains unknown.

146
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,107
The Earth's human population
is approaching that of...

147
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:48,876
...the number of
neurons in the brain.

148
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:53,813
Douglas Rushkoff proposes that the
consciousness of the Earth itself...

149
00:19:53,842 --> 00:20:01,090
...might be awakened when all humans on
Earth become collectively networked.

150
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:08,961
The network's evolution would
follow a neural model,

151
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:12,831
and just as neurons within the human
brain are connected by synapses,

152
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:17,441
the Earth itself would
become a neural network.

153
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:46,939
There is only one truth. God.

154
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:49,939
Yes. Me.

155
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:55,847
Masami Eiri, Chief Researcher
at Tachibana General Labs,

156
00:20:56,238 --> 00:21:00,414
further developed the hypothesis
of a worldwide neural network.

157
