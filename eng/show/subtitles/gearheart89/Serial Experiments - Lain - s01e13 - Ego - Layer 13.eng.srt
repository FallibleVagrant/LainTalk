1
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:21,755
I thought I was innocent,
but I'm being punished.

2
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:27,022
I didn't start this, but I
have to finish it somehow.

3
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:50,053
I can't say I didn't know about it,
but I don't remember taking part in it.

4
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:56,524
I get the feeling my
freedom cost me dearly,

5
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,803
but I don't remember
selling my soul cheaply.

6
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,174
Hey. hey!

7
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:11,638
Until I die and say goodbye...

8
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,179
Hey. hey!

9
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:21,591
...I"IO one can catch me.

10
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:29,390
You probably don't know
the eternal outlaws...

11
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:34,798
...who wander the distant night.

12
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:55,086
I... I'm confused again.

13
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,289
Am I here? Or am I there?

14
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:02,563
Over there, I'm everywhere.
I know that.

15
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,066
I'm connected there, after all.

16
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,468
Right?

17
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,838
But where is the real me?

18
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,868
Oh, right... There is no real me.

19
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,512
I only exist inside those people
who are aware of my existence.

20
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,775
But this me that's
talking right now...

21
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,778
It's me, isn't it?

22
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:29,791
This me that's talking...
This me... Who is it?

23
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,141
Arisu!

24
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:43,692
A body doesn't mean
anything to you, right?

25
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,297
Arisu...

26
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,353
No!

27
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,361
I mess up everything I try
to do for you, huh, Arisu?

28
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,732
Honest, I...

29
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:42,978
Arisu!

30
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,111
Arisu!

31
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,662
I'm sorry...

32
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,594
I'm sorry...

33
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,465
Arisu, I'm sorry...

34
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,063
I'm done.

35
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,600
Hey, you didn't clean your plate.

36
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,503
She says she's on a diet.

37
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,978
Tell the whole world, why don't you?

38
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,554
Oh, I might get a package
today. It's C.O. D.

39
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,254
If it comes, pay for it, okay?

40
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,455
Computer parts again?

41
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,162
Hey...

42
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,469
Yes?

43
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,846
No, it's nothing.

44
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,918
Arisu!

45
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:13,422
Arisu! We're going out tonight, right?

46
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,897
Cyberia! Cyberia!

47
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,832
Oh. Sure, why not?

48
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,267
I'd better mail her, then.

49
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:23,363
Arisu? Mail <i>who?</i>

50
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,110
Oh, don't tell me you want
her to come along again...

51
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:40,821
u Her"?

52
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,128
Chisa?

53
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,658
Yeah. Chisa Yomoda.

54
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,667
Arisu, you talked us into
taking her to Cyberia once,

55
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,434
but it's like she just didn't care.

56
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,240
Inviting her is pointless.

57
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,636
- Oh, I get it...
- Huh?

58
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,143
It's nothing.

59
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,084
I just thought of something strange.

60
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,119
Something strange?

61
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:15,125
If you don't remember something,
it never happened.

62
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,319
Don't remember?

63
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,660
If you aren't remembered,
you never existed.

64
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,533
Who are you talking about?

65
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,229
Who are you talking about?

66
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,833
Like I said. Nobody.

67
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,342
C'mon, we'd better hit the books.

68
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,540
Arisu!

69
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:46,912
Go!

70
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,526
Man, I gotta do it <i>again?</i>

71
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,162
C'mon, one more time!

72
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,391
Hurry UP!

73
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,024
Wait for me!

74
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,263
You're such a sucker!

75
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,333
Mail?

76
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,500
What is it?

77
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,706
Who's that girl?!

78
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,547
I don't know.

79
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,916
<i>Now</i> what?

80
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,614
Hey, nice machine!

81
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,359
Mine's pretty tricked out, too.

82
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,893
C'mon! Hurry!

83
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,220
C'mon! C'mon!

84
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,489
Mom's waiting!

85
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,164
Okay, okay... 'Bye.

86
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,201
Let's go!

87
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,641
Wait! Shoot for it again!

88
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,173
Hurry up, Taro!

89
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,444
No fair! Shoot for it again!

90
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,983
I'll quit. I'll quit that dump.

91
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,527
The crap they make me do...

92
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,251
They all underestimate me...

93
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,430
Oh, well.

94
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,935
I'm gonna quit... I'm gonna quit!

95
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,890
I'm gonna quit!

96
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,521
I'm gonna quit today for sure!

97
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,498
Is that true?

98
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,710
Why are you crying?

99
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:34,243
Because you deleted yourself
from everyone's memory?

100
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,653
But isn't that what you wanted?

101
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,492
Yes, but...

102
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:50,824
No one is dying, and
no one is being hurt.

103
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,236
And no one hates you.

104
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,129
Yes, but...

105
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,842
Dead people's information isn't
leaking out of the Wired anymore.

106
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,847
So Lain doesn't need to
be anywhere anymore.

107
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,425
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

108
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,732
You sound just like him.

109
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,228
Him?

110
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,633
That man never existed now.

111
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:29,572
Even if he does, he won't get any
ideas into his head about being God.

112
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,769
I'm nowhere now...

113
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,570
If I'm nowhere, who am I?

114
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,011
Where am I?

115
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,811
You yourself said it.

116
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,352
The Wired isn't an upper
layer of the real world.

117
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,115
That's what that man
was mistaken about.

118
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,787
A network is a field to
pass along information.

119
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,631
Information doesn't
stand still there.

120
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,635
Information functions by
always being in motion.

121
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,133
Really?

122
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:09,170
People's memories aren’t just personal
or one part of the history of humanity.

123
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,512
No, not even the
shared unconscious.

124
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,254
Do you think that humans could
create something that could store...

125
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,184
"memory that's that vast?

126
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,819
The Wired was just connected
to something else...

127
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,697
But where was it connected to?

128
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,804
Do people really need to know that?

129
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:44,108
Look at how far they've
come without knowing.

130
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:49,550
The human world creates and
prays to its various gods,

131
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,212
and humans convince themselves,
"This is how the world is."

132
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,054
I don't like how you're saying this.

133
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,525
Either way, it's Lain
that's saying it. Me.

134
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,125
You understand that, right?

135
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,968
Oh, right... Lain was
never a person, was she?

136
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,473
Lain is omnipresent,
existing everywhere.

137
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,218
Lain watches quietly.

138
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,383
Right, Lain is God!

139
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,047
No...

140
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,826
You're wrong!

141
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,863
It'd be so much easier
if you became God.

142
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,861
I think it'd be a lot
easier than being a human.

143
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:46,208
You wouldn't have to do anything.
just stand there and watch.

144
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,078
No one would look down on Lain.

145
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,947
No one would hate Lain.

146
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,107
That's...

147
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:05,887
Hey, Lain... Let's start everything
over again from the beginning!

148
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,160
I mean,you <i>did</i> go and
reset everything, after all...

149
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,130
Stop it!

150
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,957
Then what are you, Lain?

151
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,694
I...

152
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,537
I...

153
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,669
Where am I?

154
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,272
Come, Lain.

155
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,390
Dad?

156
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:35,782
You don't need to wear
that anymore, Lain.

157
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,722
Dad, do you know?

158
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,127
What?

159
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,759
I... Everyone, I...

160
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,030
You love them?

161
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,868
Isn't that right?

162
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,876
Lain, I'll make us some
nice tea next time.

163
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:12,747
Hey, with some madeleines!
Definitely. They're great!

164
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:27,069
So memories aren't only
of the past, <i>are</i> they?

165
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:32,201
They can be of right now,
or even of tomorrow...

166
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,482
Unbelievable!

167
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,576
Isn't it? But hang on a second...

168
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:46,686
I listened to what you had to say.

169
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,182
Very patiently, I might add.

170
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,759
I get to pick the curtains
for the bedroom, right?

171
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,123
Yes, ma'am.

172
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,998
Anything you say.

173
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,129
All right, then.
That's a good student.

174
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,541
Something wrong?

175
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,872
No.

176
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,214
Sorry, could you wait here a minute?

177
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,751
Hey, what're you--

178
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,742
Hello.

179
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,811
Hello.

180
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,781
Have we met before?
We <i>have,</i> haven't we?

181
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,852
Did you go to the school I
was a student teacher at?

182
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,627
No, that can't be it...

183
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,096
Let me think...

184
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,059
Pleased to meet you.

185
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,490
Huh?

186
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,737
Pleased to meet you.
We haven't met before.

187
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,537
Oh. Well, I'm pleased
to meet you, then.

188
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,607
I'm Arisu.

189
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:18,908
Strange name, huh? I'm kind
of embarrassed about it.

190
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,446
What's yours?

191
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,747
Lain.

192
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,512
Lain...?

193
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,854
- A friend of yours?
- No, I thought she was someone else.

194
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,523
Well, goodbye, Lain.

195
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,768
Maybe we'll run into
each other again someday.

196
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,269
'Bye.

197
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,874
'Bye, Lain.

198
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,316
You're right. We can
see each other anytime.

199
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:24,678
I'm here, so I'll be
with you forever.

200
00:23:54,766 --> 00:24:03,242
I thought I was innocent,
but I'm being punished.

201
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:08,508
I didn't start this, but I
have to finish it somehow.

202
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:31,539
I can't say I didn't know about it,
but I don't remember taking part in it.

203
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:38,010
I get the feeling my
freedom cost me dearly,

204
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:45,290
but I don't remember
selling my soul cheaply.

205
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:46,661
Hey. hey!

206
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:53,125
Until I die and say goodbye...

207
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,666
Hey. hey!

208
00:24:55,694 --> 00:25:03,044
...no one can catch me.

209
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:10,878
You probably don't know
the eternal outlaws...
