1
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,372
Why? Why won't you come?

2
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,969
I wish you would come here...

3
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,839
Look! Look at that!

4
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,603
Gotcha!

5
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,579
Hey, cut it out!

6
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:27,444
Why?

7
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,213
Don't!

8
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,051
What's the problem?
Don't play hard to get!

9
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,158
Come on, let's go someplace happy.

10
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,334
What the hell?

11
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,531
What happened?!

12
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,971
W-We don't know anything! W-We've
got nothing to do with this!

13
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,774
- She came outta nowhere...
- Oh, no...

14
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,479
Damn it...

15
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,856
What a racket...

16
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,865
Can't you be quiet?

17
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,698
Juri, don't make such
a big deal about it.

18
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,263
Yeah, it's just some stupid prank.

19
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,104
B-But...

20
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,011
It'll be okay.

21
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,049
Lain?

22
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,252
Did you get one, too?

23
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,962
Get what?

24
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,595
E-mail!

25
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,529
E-mail?

26
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,868
From Chisa Yomoda!

27
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:45,168
I... I'm not very
good with computers.

28
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,237
You should at least check
your mail once a day.

29
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,941
Well, it's up to you, I guess.

30
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,050
<i>Lain's such a baby.</i>

31
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,124
Why is she crying?

32
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:05,459
Because she got an e-mail from
Chisa Yomoda, that's why!

33
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,999
Chisa? Who's that?

34
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,531
She was in class D.

35
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,093
She killed herself last week by
jumping off a building in Shibuya.

36
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,264
Come on, the teacher told everybody!

37
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,733
It's not just Juri.

38
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,246
Lots of people have gotten
mail from her this week.

39
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,442
But she's...

40
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,183
Right. You shouldn't be
getting mail from a dead girl.

41
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,215
But there it is.

42
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,213
Powering up... Working...

43
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,373
Just a little longer...

44
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,641
Log in.

45
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,615
Who are you?

46
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:33,028
Lain. Please say your name.

47
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,469
La-i-n.

48
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,099
Accepted.

49
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,240
You must be Lain.

50
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:47,243
Lain has mail.

51
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,316
<i>From who?</i>

52
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,485
Chisa Yomoda.

53
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,755
Do you wish to read your mail?

54
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:03,260
Hello, how are you?

55
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,994
Hello.

56
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,734
How are you?

57
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:24,246
Lain, I walked home with you
just once. Do you remember?

58
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:31,819
I have only given up my body.

59
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:36,994
By doing this, I can explain
to you that I am still alive.

60
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:43,103
I wanted to let you know this, Lain,
so I sent this e-mail to you.

61
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:47,305
Do you understand?
It's okay if you can't right now.

62
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:51,778
You will all understand
soon. Everyone will.

63
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,148
Why did you die?

64
00:12:56,041 --> 00:13:01,252
Rumor at school has it that
this is a prank e-mail,

65
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:05,828
but I want you to know
that it isn't, Lain.

66
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,400
Why? Why did you die?

67
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:20,371
God is here.

68
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,977
Huh?

69
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:28,542
God...

70
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:52,073
I ate lunch late today. I'm done.

71
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,077
Morn?

72
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,380
Yes?

73
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,149
I got an e-mail.

74
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:11,024
From a girl who killed
herself last week.

75
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,532
What is it, Lain?

76
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:02,372
It's certainly unusual
to see you in here.

77
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,997
<i>I...</i>

78
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,730
I was wondering if you
could buy me a new Navi...

79
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,102
Finally caught the bug, huh?

80
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,409
You're in junior high now.

81
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,255
Your friends are leaving
you in the dust, right?

82
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,417
I keep telling you that you
should use a better machine.

83
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,630
You know, Lain, in this world,

84
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,434
whether it's here in the
real world or in the Wired,

85
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:06,533
people connect to each other, and
that's how societies function.

86
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,351
Even a girl like you can make
friends right off the bat, Lain.

87
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,389
There's nothing to be afraid of.

88
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:26,594
I wonder why your mother
can't understand that...?

89
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,669
I'm not scared.

90
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,179
But why bring up your
Navi all of a sudden?

91
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,681
There's a friend I want to see.

92
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,405
- What happened?
- Damn it...

93
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,482
We apologize for the inconvenience,
ladies and gentlemen.

94
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,877
The train is currently stopped
due to an accident.

95
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,179
What?

96
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,712
Was someone hit?

97
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,452
I can't believe this...

98
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,816
Miss lwakura.

99
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,358
Miss lwakura.

100
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,759
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

101
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,826
This will be on the test.

102
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,594
Chisa...?

103
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,231
Where are you?

104
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,393
Wait!

105
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:37,757
I thought I was innocent,
but I'm being punished.

106
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:42,989
I didn't start this, but I
have to finish it somehow.

107
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:06,021
I can't say I didn't know about it,
but I don't remember taking part in it.

108
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:12,492
I get the feeling <i>my</i>
freedom cost me dearly,

109
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:19,804
but I don't remember
selling my soul cheaply.

110
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,176
Hey, hey!

111
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:27,639
Until I die and say goodbye...

112
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,180
Hey, hey!

113
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:37,592
...no one will ever catch me.

114
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:45,393
You probably don't know
the eternal outlaws...

115
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,799
...who wander the distant night.
