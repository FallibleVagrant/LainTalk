1
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,159
What are you scared of?

2
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:14,419
Just try it for a little bit.

3
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:24,583
No, that's not it.

4
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:31,314
I don't have any mail...

5
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:36,519
I don't get it...

6
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:40,600
<i>Oh.</i>

7
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:45,237
I thought somebody was here.

8
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,041
Who?

9
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:53,704
Your imaginary friend.

10
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,677
Or something like that.

11
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:06,788
You're gonna be late again.

12
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:16,897
Lain!

13
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,002
Good morning.

14
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:24,763
Good morning.

15
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:27,871
See what I mean?
It couldn't have been her.

16
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:30,444
You think so? But...

17
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:33,943
What?

18
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:40,015
Cut it out. I feel sorry for her.

19
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,984
It's nothing. Come on, let's go.

20
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,522
Okay.

21
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,822
But...

22
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,360
Oh, let it go.

23
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:55,632
Have you gotten any more e-mail?

24
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,502
E-mail?

25
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,237
From Chisa.

26
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,011
Oh, that. No, I haven't
gotten any more.

27
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,741
You got that prank mail, too, Lain?

28
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:08,907
What?

29
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:10,075
Really?

30
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:15,115
I was just curious.

31
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:16,655
Huh?

32
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,590
You know, maybe she does
look a little like her...

33
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:23,326
Lain, what were you
doing last night?

34
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,691
Yeah, yeah!

35
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:27,899
Come on, I'm telling
you it wasn't her!

36
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:30,961
I guess not. She doesn't
look like her at all.

37
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,036
What?

38
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:40,546
There was a girl at Cyberia last
night who looked just like you, Lain.

39
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,276
Cyberia?

40
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:48,653
We finally worked up the
nerve to go there last night.

41
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:51,388
Come on, it wasn't such a big deal.

42
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:53,926
Oh, right, you were the
one who was all nervous!

43
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:59,355
Oh. It's a club. Young
people go there at night.

44
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:05,771
There was a girl there who
looked a little like you, Lain.

45
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:09,135
Last night, I...

46
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:12,379
We know. It wasn't you.

47
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:14,879
We didn't get a good look at her,

48
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:19,610
but she had on these wild clothes,
and chewed people out left and right.

49
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:23,683
Yeah, it was like she
was your total opposite.

50
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,485
But she did look like her...

51
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,627
Hey, I know! Let's take
her with us next time!

52
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,890
You want to make sure, huh?

53
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:35,528
Cut it out! You're just
making fun of her.

54
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:41,539
I bet when a girl like Lain goes to
a club, her personality does a 180!

55
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:46,211
Oh. Maybe Lain would liven up a bit.

56
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:49,010
Right! Let's go, Lain!

57
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,485
It might be fun.

58
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:56,249
You'd have more fun if you were
a little more sociable, Lain.

59
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,049
Right, Lain?

60
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,226
Accela, a type of smart supplement,

61
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,326
uses nano-mechanisms to oscillate at
a specific frequency within the body,

62
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:13,235
triggering the secretion
of a specific hormone.

63
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:19,102
It is said that when secreted, this
hormone affects the time-sense...

64
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:24,049
of the human mind, making it seem
as if one's awareness is accelerated.

65
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,854
Not only the consciousness, but the
workings of the brain itself are altered,

66
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:34,918
multiplying the brain's operational
capacity by 2 to 12 times.

67
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:41,902
The nano-mechanism itself is destroyed
by digestive juices within 24 hours,

68
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:44,937
but it is unknown how
long its effectiveness...

69
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,014
Is this your place?

70
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:12,047
Great! I have a delivery for you.

71
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:15,054
I'll start unloading it.
Could you get the gate for me?

72
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,797
Could you sign this, please?

73
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,409
This thing is so cool!

74
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,946
I wish I had one of these...

75
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,407
Thanks.

76
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:44,608
All this is yours?

77
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:47,352
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

78
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:50,416
Then you don't know what this is?

79
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:54,692
It's a top of the line Navi!

80
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:56,424
Fully loaded, too!

81
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:59,823
With this kind of horsepower,
you can move around freely...

82
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:03,268
...without any stress at
all, even in the Wired.

83
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:08,875
I use a home-brew system, myself.
it doesn't hold a candle to this.

84
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:14,170
No, it's not like that. I don't
know anything about it, either.

85
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:17,574
You will soon enough.

86
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:19,117
Have a good one.

87
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,589
Your Navi came, right?

88
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:06,258
Get that mess cleaned up soon,
all right? It's in the way.

89
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:10,335
I'll set it up for you after dinner.

90
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,706
This Navi's good enough that
I'd want to take it for a spin.

91
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,470
Dad...

92
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:22,239
I want you to set it up now.

93
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:26,117
Hey, why are you in such a hurry?

94
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:31,555
Lain...

95
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,323
I'll do it.

96
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:41,859
You can't keep using that
children's Navi forever.

97
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:46,732
For communication, you
need a powerful system...

98
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:51,868
...that will mature alongside
your relationships with people.

99
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:54,071
Understand, Lain?

100
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,216
Come here.

101
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,728
Register yourself as
the machine's user.

102
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,902
Try talking to it.

103
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,507
Hello, Navi.

104
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,151
Now this Navi's yours, Lain.

105
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,615
You can show off to
your friends now.

106
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:42,757
Oops.

107
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:45,331
Hey, Mika. Something wrong?

108
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:57,041
Navi, do I have mail?

109
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,376
Lain has no mail.

110
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,688
Okay, turn left at that corner!

111
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:44,357
Then go straight ahead.

112
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:46,916
See it?

113
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,054
Yeah.

114
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:51,357
We're in the basement! Got it?

115
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,767
Hey! You!

116
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,403
You're blocking the stairs.

117
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:07,876
Sorry.

118
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:10,114
If you do it that way,

119
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:13,052
...you'll get spotted by the
Info-Guard Center right off the bat!

120
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,288
What's the big deal?
I'd just be attacking it.

121
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,621
Hey, next time we go over
to that game center, let's...

122
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,058
What took you so long, Lain?

123
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,502
You're usually in bed now,
aren't you, Lain?

124
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:35,064
Lain, don't you have anything
better to wear out at night?

125
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,545
We'll pick out something a little
more grown-up for you next time, Lain.

126
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,111
You think she'd look good
in grown-up clothes?

127
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,209
Reika!

128
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:46,880
<i>Hey ...</i>

129
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:47,817
What?

130
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:51,689
I guess the girl we saw
really wasn't Lain...

131
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:54,892
That's what I've been telling you!

132
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:58,795
Lain doesn't dress like
that or talk like that.

133
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,798
She doesn't look like that, either.

134
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:05,463
Did she really look like me?

135
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:09,308
Yeah! I was positive it was you!

136
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:11,739
<i>Oh.</i>

137
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,175
What the-J?!

138
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,577
He's got a gun!

139
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,194
Help me!

140
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,595
- Juri!
- Juri!

141
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,095
Lain!

142
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,692
What's she doing?

143
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:10,468
- Reika, take care of Juri.
- Arisu?

144
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,764
Arisu!

145
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:18,708
What're you looking at?

146
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:23,646
Lain, what're you doing?
Let's get out of here! Hurry!

147
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:24,809
Lain!

148
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,448
Lain!

149
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:28,813
Lain!

150
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:31,815
Go away!

151
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,096
Why are you making me do this?!

152
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:47,297
What right do you have?!

153
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:51,001
I just wanted to clear
my head, that's all!

154
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:54,006
I don't know anything about
it! Leave me out of it!

155
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:56,815
You're that scattered god's--

156
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:59,585
I don't want anything to
do with it! Nothing!

157
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:03,319
The Wired can't be allowed to
interfere with the real world!

158
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:05,048
I don't want anything to do with it!

159
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:07,659
Who the hell are you?!

160
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:09,656
L-Lain...

161
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,432
I don't want anything to do with it...
Don't want anything to do with it...

162
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:20,801
Don't want... I don't want... Don't
want anything to do with it...

163
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:22,465
Don't want anything to...

164
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:24,477
Don't want...

165
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:25,840
Don't want anything...

166
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:27,446
Don't want anything to do with it...

167
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:30,114
Don't want... Don't want
anything to do with it...

168
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:31,882
I don't want--

169
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:34,176
No matter where you go,

170
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,620
everyone's connected.

171
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:36,939
I thought I was innocent,
but I'm being punished.

172
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:42,239
I didn't start this, but I
have to finish it somehow.

173
00:22:56,691 --> 00:23:05,270
I can't say I didn't know about it,
but I don't remember taking part in it.

174
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,707
I get the feeling <i>my</i>
freedom cost me dearly,

175
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:19,020
but I don't remember
selling my soul cheaply.

176
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:20,392
Hey, hey!

177
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:26,832
Until I die and say goodbye...

178
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,362
Hey, hey!

179
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:36,775
...no one will ever catch me.

180
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:44,574
You probably don't know
the eternal outlaws...

181
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:50,015
...who wander the distant night.
