1
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,215
Oh, okay...
So <i>that's</i> how it works.

2
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:09,747
I had no idea the
world was this simple.

3
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,626
I always thought the world was
such a big and scary place,

4
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:18,591
but once you figure it
out, it's all so easy.

5
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:21,426
See? I told you it would be.

6
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,884
That's terrible, Lain!

7
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,658
I can't believe you just said that!

8
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:50,721
Lain...

9
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:54,862
I know, but it's true!

10
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:56,860
That's the first I've heard of it!

11
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,031
<i>What does it mean?</i>

12
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:00,974
Acting all high and
mighty again, huh, Lain?

13
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,167
That reminds me, Juri.

14
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:05,745
What?

15
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:31,564
But that's...

16
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:37,136
But that's--

17
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,509
Unbelievable...

18
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:39,841
Aw, c'mon...!

19
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,119
People only have substance
within the memories of others.

20
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:54,823
That's why there were
all kinds of me's.

21
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,557
There weren't a lot of me's,

22
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:01,425
I was just inside all sorts
of people, that's all.

23
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,205
Really... No kidding?

24
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:15,174
Come on, Taro, who
are you talking to?

25
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:17,779
W-What's up?

26
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,154
You know, I...

27
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:24,992
I kissed an angel.

28
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:29,656
Taro...

29
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,371
Lain...

30
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:46,409
Lain...

31
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:47,643
Lain...

32
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:49,207
Lain...

33
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,179
Lain...

34
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,484
Lain...

35
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:53,245
Lain...

36
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:54,921
Lain...

37
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:57,416
Lain...

38
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:08,829
Protocol Seven is expected to allow
the seamless sharing of information...

39
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:13,202
...between the Wired
and the real world.

40
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:16,769
And now, the following message...

41
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,312
Let's all love Lain!

42
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,675
Let's all love Lain!

43
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:20,806
Let's all love Lain!

44
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,781
Let's all love Lain!

45
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:32,784
All the functions of the human
body, without exception,

46
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:37,861
...can be put into words and
described in materialistic terms.

47
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:41,566
The body is nothing but a machine.

48
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,706
If the physical limitations of the
body restrict mankind's evolution,

49
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,398
it would be as if the fall of
the species called "man"...

50
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:52,202
...had already been decided by
a God that doesn't even exist.

51
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,343
The information etched inside
humans isn't only that which...

52
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:58,045
...they themselves have
acquired as individuals.

53
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,382
This species called man is
connected to his predecessors,

54
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:04,180
and information has
accumulated within him.

55
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:10,097
If that information isn't shared,
it's meaningless. Mere <i>data.</i>

56
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,893
Mankind can evolve.
Evolve by their own power.

57
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:19,137
But to do that, they must
first know what they truly are.

58
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:21,972
What do you think you are?

59
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,741
Originally, people were
connected to each other.

60
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:29,774
All I've done is to make
things as they once were.

61
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,083
That's what you have done, Lain.

62
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:36,186
So you can do anything you want.

63
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:27,897
I thought you quit smoking.

64
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:36,340
Why is this happening? We did
exactly what we were told to do!

65
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:40,410
It means that our client wasn't
the only one who thought that...

66
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,686
...those computer geeks playing
"secret society" would be trouble.

67
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,224
What do you mean?

68
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:50,021
Our client was in
contact with Masami Eiri.

69
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:56,532
No, maybe Eiri was behind it all.

70
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,733
Enough about Eiri, okay?

71
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,433
The guy's dead.

72
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,911
He's not dead.

73
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:17,416
Whether he had a body
or not never mattered.

74
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,684
It never mattered.

75
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,486
Are you serious?

76
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:05,672
Payment for services rendered, huh?

77
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:08,641
You've been using us, <i>haven?</i> you?!

78
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:12,012
Interpret it any way you like.

79
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,771
You want us to leave town,
huh?And go <i>where?</i>

80
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:23,789
I suppose a place with no power lines
that isn't covered by a satellite.

81
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,689
There's no place like that
on Earth, and you know it!

82
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:32,689
If you're going to run, you'll
have to find a place like that.

83
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,700
What's going to happen?

84
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:41,132
What are you planning to do...

85
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:45,475
...by connecting the Wired to the
real world without any devices?

86
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:52,581
Something wonderful
is going to happen.

87
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,317
I'm looking forward
to it. Aren't you?

88
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,103
What the-?

89
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,609
What's wrong?!

90
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:23,449
What are you seeing?!

91
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:26,011
<i>Hey!</i>

92
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:44,798
lwakura

93
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,232
Lain?

94
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:18,251
No...!

95
00:13:58,187 --> 00:14:01,031
This is Lain's room?

96
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:06,534
Lain?

97
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:20,178
L-Lain!

98
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,558
A... risu?

99
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,588
What did you do?

100
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:32,665
Nothing.

101
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:35,328
I've just been watching.

102
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,801
Watching what?

103
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,905
I... I thought I had gone crazy.

104
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:50,711
But I didn't!

105
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:53,714
Lain! Why did you leave only me?

106
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:59,586
Why did you only leave
my memories alone?

107
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,060
Why do I always have to remember
all those horrible things?!

108
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:10,393
Do you hate me that much, Lain?

109
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:16,741
I... I can't take this!

110
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:20,079
No... You've got it all wrong, Arisu.

111
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:24,612
I didn't want to hurt you.

112
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,382
Liar! Look at what you've done!

113
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:32,988
But <i>you’re</i> okay, aren't you, Arisu?

114
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:38,997
You were my friend, even without
connecting with me, Arisu.

115
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:41,932
What are you saying?

116
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:47,372
You're my only friend, Arisu.

117
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,573
Even without connecting with me.

118
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:53,640
"Connecting"? W-What do you mean?

119
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:59,578
Connecting to me... And everyone...

120
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,014
S-Stop!

121
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,353
I love you, Arisu.

122
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,490
Do you know what you're saying, Lain?

123
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,526
Humans were originally connected
at an unconscious level.

124
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,992
I reconnected them, that's all.

125
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:17,460
Lain, you...?

126
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:21,237
I don't do anything.

127
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:25,612
It doesn't matter which is real,
this side or the other...

128
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,179
I was in both.

129
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:31,673
I'm a program designed
to destroy the barrier...

130
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:33,448
...between the Wired
and the real world.

131
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:36,684
You're a program, Lain...?

132
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:41,659
You and everyone else, Arisu,
you’re just applications.

133
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:45,055
The truth is, you
don't <i>need</i> bodies.

134
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,117
You're wrong.

135
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:19,764
I don't really understand what you're
saying, but I think you're wrong.

136
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:26,171
Your body's cold, but
you're alive, Lain.

137
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:30,407
Mine, too. See?

138
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:43,120
See? My heart...

139
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:46,222
...it's beating.

140
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:48,786
Beating... Beating...

141
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:54,358
But why? Why's it beating like that?

142
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:58,461
Because I'm scared.
It's pounding because I'm scared.

143
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:01,640
But you're smiling, Arisu.

144
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,240
Yeah, I guess I am. But I'm scared.

145
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,710
I've always been scared.
I wonder why?

146
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,479
I wonder why?

147
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:13,545
Because she's afraid
of losing her body.

148
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:17,223
All sensations are caused
by impulses in the brain.

149
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,654
You just need to block
the unpleasant impulses.

150
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:24,931
Select only the happy, pleasant ones.

151
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:28,124
Really?

152
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:31,070
Lain? Who are you talking to?

153
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,909
If you really love her, why
don't you connect with her?

154
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:38,874
I'm not sure.

155
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:41,643
Lain? Who are you talking to?

156
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,774
Lain!

157
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:45,247
You must have a bug.

158
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:50,356
Very well. I'll take my time and
give you a thorough debugging.

159
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,559
Come, Lain.

160
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:07,466
What I don't understand is <i>you</i>, God.

161
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:11,371
Y-You're... talking to <i>God?</i>

162
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:15,948
What don't you understand, Lain?

163
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:21,385
What you did was to remove
devices from the Wired.

164
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:25,716
Phones... Television...
The network...

165
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,694
Without those, you couldn't
have done anything.

166
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:33,791
Yes. Those are things which
accompanied human evolution.

167
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,034
Humans who are further
evolved than others...

168
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,802
...have a right to
greater abilities.

169
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:46,839
Who gave you those rights?

170
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:54,317
The program that inserted
code synched to the Earth's...

171
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,516
...characteristic frequency into
the Protocol Seven code,

172
00:19:56,545 --> 00:20:00,254
which would raise the collective
unconscious to the conscious level.

173
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:04,893
Did you really come up
with the idea by yourself?

174
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:08,731
What are you getting at?

175
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,427
No, it can't be... It can't be!

176
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,000
Are you telling me that
there really is a God?!

177
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:24,474
It doesn't matter. With no
body, you can't understand.

178
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:29,082
It's a lie! I... I'm Omnipotent!

179
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,324
I gave you a body here
in the real world!

180
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:37,588
You were omnipresent, scattered
through the Wired! I gave you an ego!

181
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:38,791
You mean to say-

182
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:42,460
lf that's true of me,
what about <i>you</i>?

183
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:46,134
I'm different! I--

184
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:02,479
The Wired isn't an upper
layer of the real world.

185
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,252
What do you mean?

186
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,120
Inside the Wired,
you were God, all right.

187
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:11,727
But what about <i>before</i>
the Wired was created?

188
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:15,595
You’re just an acting God,
standing in for someone...

189
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:19,228
...who was waiting for the Wired
to reach its current state.

190
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:22,367
An "acting” God?!

191
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,200
That can't be!

192
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:31,542
Arisu!

193
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:37,980
A body doesn't mean
anything to you, right?

194
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:50,330
No!

195
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:36,873
I thought I was innocent,
but I'm being punished.

196
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:42,139
I didn't start this, but I
have to finish it somehow.

197
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:05,170
I can't say I didn't know about it,
but I don't remember taking part in it.

198
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:11,641
I get the feeling my
freedom cost me dearly,

199
00:23:12,207 --> 00:23:18,920
but I don't remember
selling my soul cheaply.

200
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:20,291
Hey. hey!

201
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:26,755
Until I die and say goodbye...

202
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:29,296
Hey. hey!

203
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:36,708
...no one can catch me.

204
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,507
You probably don't know
the eternal outlaws...

205
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:49,915
...who wander the distant night.
