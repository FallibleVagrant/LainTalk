1
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:42,612
There is only one truth. God.

2
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:54,158
Yes. Me.

3
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:58,266
Isn't that right, Lain?

4
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:21,190
You're God?

5
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,494
Yes. I'm God.

6
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:37,636
Why are you God?
I don't understand.

7
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:45,978
You're dead, aren't you?
A dead <i>human.</i>

8
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:49,746
Somebody like that
can't be God, can they?

9
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:56,296
I realized that I had
no need for a body.

10
00:03:57,353 --> 00:04:01,426
To die is merely to
abandon the flesh.

11
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,104
That's... That's just
what Chisa said.

12
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:17,542
I suppose she did, at that.

13
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:22,415
I caused the protocol that
governs the Wired to evolve.

14
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,155
Yeah. That's what you did.

15
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,697
But a protocol is just an agreement.

16
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:37,801
Yes, but I incorporated code that
operates on a higher phase.

17
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:40,205
SQ?

18
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:49,039
There is compressed information
mixed into the protocol.

19
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:51,980
What kind of information?

20
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,121
Human memories. <i>Mine.</i>

21
00:04:55,311 --> 00:05:00,317
The thoughts, history, memories, and
emotions of the man named Masami Eiri.

22
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:05,356
What does that mean?

23
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,996
I can live forever as an
anonymous entity in the Wired,

24
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:14,098
and will be able to rule
it with information.

25
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:18,941
What do you think a being like
that should be called?

26
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,513
A god.

27
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,414
There is no God.

28
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:30,749
Yes. Even if I were an omnipresent
being and could influence others,

29
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,057
with no one to worship
me, I'm no god.

30
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:39,193
But you had them. Or <i>made</i>
them, I should say.

31
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,692
Knights.

32
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:03,721
You no longer need a body, Lain.

33
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,463
That's a lie!

34
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,296
Talk about <i>lame!</i>

35
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:30,679
Some people are like that, I guess.

36
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:33,050
Sol said, go ahead and do it.

37
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:34,387
Anyway...

38
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:38,386
- Hey, look at this!
- Isn't it <i>cute?</i>

39
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:42,693
It was really cheap!

40
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:44,459
- At that place next door?
- Yeah, over there!

41
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:46,460
- Let's go, let's go!
- Today?

42
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,364
Sure, we don't have
anything after school today.

43
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:50,735
Hey, you're right.

44
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:51,894
Let's go!

45
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,586
Stand!

46
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,382
BOW!

47
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,460
All right, close your books.

48
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,250
I... I'm real...!

49
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,325
I'm alive...!

50
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:51,696
I'm here.

51
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:55,530
Why is this happening?

52
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:58,637
Was it something I did?

53
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:03,574
I always tried to keep something
like this from happening.

54
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,547
I always tried not to
say anything weird.

55
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,150
Can it be true...?

56
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,514
I'm not supposed to have a body?

57
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:21,253
That's right, Lain.

58
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:25,863
You're not needed in the real world.

59
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,321
I'm home.

60
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,841
Dad...?

61
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:55,980
This is goodbye, Miss Lain.

62
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:03,513
You must have figured it out by now.
Our work here is finished.

63
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,355
It was only for a short time, but
I know I didn't do enough for you.

64
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:11,756
You're now free to become
anything you want.

65
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:15,534
No, you were free all along.

66
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:22,140
I wasn't given permission to
say goodbye, but I loved you.

67
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:30,179
It's not that I enjoyed
playing house...

68
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:35,779
Maybe I envied a being like you.

69
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:37,956
Good bye.

70
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:46,790
Wait!

71
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,570
Don't leave me alone!

72
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:56,367
Alone? You're not alone.

73
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,439
If you connect to the Wired,
everyone will welcome you.

74
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:07,045
That's the sort of being you were.

75
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:29,704
I'm not alone.

76
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,382
Do you want to do anything, Lain?

77
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:51,564
This is your world, Lain.

78
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:58,805
Who are the Knights? They're the
ones who made the fake me, right?

79
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:00,672
I'm not sure.

80
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,039
No, it's possible.

81
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:04,603
They say you can trace
the origin of the...

82
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:07,842
...Knights of the Eastern Calculus
back to the Knights Templar.

83
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:12,616
They've used that invisible human
network, the collective unconscious,

84
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:16,589
since long before
the Wired was born.

85
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,955
What do you want to do, Lain?

86
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:23,627
Knights...

87
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:25,628
Who are the Knights?

88
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,067
You really want to know,
don't you, Lain?

89
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:35,432
The Wired's God is a god
because He has worshippers.

90
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:06,034
Hey, Taro... Let's
go someplace else.

91
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:08,300
This place has gotten boring.

92
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,309
Yeah. Why not come over to my house?

93
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,646
You don't need to come, Masayuki.

94
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,073
What's the big idea?

95
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,619
Taro says he doesn't wanna hang
out with a little kid like you.

96
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:23,420
Wha--?

97
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:25,817
You're as much a kid
as I am, Myu-Myu!

98
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,689
It's okay for a girl! Everybody knows
that younger is better for girls.

99
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,528
Right, Taro?

100
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:35,297
What's that?

101
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:39,571
What's up, Taro? ls there
something on the Net News?

102
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:41,432
It's a list.

103
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,170
Huh? What kind of list?

104
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:48,978
What's a list of Knights members
doing on the Net News"?

105
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,855
Y-Yes 7

106
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,735
Please remain silent.

107
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:17,009
W-Who are you?

108
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,705
Time to pay the piper, all right?

109
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:20,077
W-What do you mean?

110
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:55,272
Mom, I got killed!

111
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,073
Mom!

112
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:01,683
It's your turn, Mom! If you don't
hurry up, I'm gonna keep playing!

113
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:04,051
Okay, Mom?

114
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:08,257
I'm gonna take 'em out!

115
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,834
A series of suicides occurred
today all over the world,

116
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:18,471
and each country's Information
Control Ministry...

117
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:20,665
...and police departments have
begun investigating the cause.

118
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:25,946
Each victim was involved
in network-related work,

119
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:29,671
and sources tell us that it appears
that they were all members...

120
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:32,914
...of a fraternal order
known as the " Knights."

121
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:22,692
Why did you do it?

122
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,797
It was a request from our client.

123
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:31,669
You hunted down all the
Knights in the world.

124
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:35,906
Our associates are now on
their way to dispose of them.

125
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:38,810
But why...?

126
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,781
The Wired can't be allowed
to be a special world.

127
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:48,517
It can only be a field that functions as
a sub-system reinforcing the real world.

128
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,798
But still...

129
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:56,795
You can't be allowed to
exist in the Wired, either.

130
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,964
But here you are, safe and sound.

131
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:05,036
Some god or whatever
must be protecting you.

132
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:11,015
Masami Eiri's residual
thought program...

133
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,519
...will eventually be
disinfected from the Wired.

134
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:21,323
Our client is working on a total
rewrite of the Protocol Seven code.

135
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,596
We have no need for gods.

136
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:31,332
Right. Not in the Wired
or in the real world.

137
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:51,521
We still haven't figured
out what you are.

138
00:18:57,252 --> 00:19:00,665
But I love you.

139
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:08,905
Love certainly is a
strange emotion, isn't it?

140
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,237
What will you do?

141
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:42,434
Well, let me think...

142
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:48,343
You don't have anyone
to pray to you now.

143
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:55,812
I can't be a god, then.
But I haven't lost <i>all</i> of them.

144
00:19:56,311 --> 00:20:00,657
If only one believer remains,
I can still be a god.

145
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:02,889
Who?

146
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:07,229
Come, now... You, Lain.

147
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:14,839
It's because of me that
you can stay yourself.

148
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,410
You were originally
born in the Wired.

149
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:24,745
The legend of the Wired. The
heroine of the Wired's fairy tales.

150
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:32,189
Liar.

151
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:37,424
The real world's Lain Iwakura
is merely a hologram of her.

152
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:40,427
A homunculus of
artificial ribosomes.

153
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:44,131
You never had a body to begin with.

154
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,140
That's a lie.

155
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:54,013
A fake family. Fake friends.
Yes, it was all a lie.

156
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,450
That's a lie...

157
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:02,856
That's all a lie...

158
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,187
Poor Lain... She's all alone.

159
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:13,962
But I'm here. The man
who loves you is here.

160
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:19,095
You should be able to love me, the
man who sent you to this world...

161
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,802
I am your creator.

162
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,137
Love me.

163
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,278
All right, Lain?

164
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,777
The other...

165
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:38,425
The other me, she's...

166
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:43,354
That isn't <i>another</i> you.
It's the <i>real</i> you.

167
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:49,360
Like it matters!
