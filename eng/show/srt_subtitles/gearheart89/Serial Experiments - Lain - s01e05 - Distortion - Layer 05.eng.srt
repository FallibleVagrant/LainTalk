1
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:17,171
If you can hear it,
it is speaking to you.

2
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:23,277
And if you can see it,
then it is your...

3
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,964
Mankind is a creature that no
longer evolves, is it not?

4
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:41,165
Compared to other animals, the cancer
rate in man is exceedingly small.

5
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:46,606
One theory says that man is a neoteny,
and is no longer able to evolve.

6
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:53,247
If this is true, then what an absurd
creature man has evolved into.

7
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,887
Not knowing what it
is that drives them,

8
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:02,251
they keep their bodies merely to
satisfy the desires of the flesh.

9
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,585
They're worthless, don't you think?

10
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,031
That's all mankind is.

11
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:20,134
But it is no longer necessary
to remain a wretched human being.

12
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:26,439
Mankind has finally created an
exit whereby he may escape.

13
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,714
What do you mean?

14
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:34,418
The network. The Wired, Lain.

15
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,486
Who are you?

16
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,987
<i>I'm God.</i>

17
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,744
Wanna go get something to eat?

18
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,214
Hey, aren't you hungry?

19
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,553
Hey, wanna go to the pool next time?

20
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,544
Oh, man...

21
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,340
Tell me a story!

22
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,018
Come on, please!

23
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,031
Tell me a story, okay?

24
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,230
What kind of story would
you like to hear, Lain?

25
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,100
Let's see...

26
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,241
Something I don't know about!

27
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:42,383
There is nothing that
you don't know.

28
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:46,049
I can't tell you a story
that doesn't exist.

29
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,987
You understand, don't you?

30
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,687
Well, how about this, then?

31
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:58,361
For every event, there
is first a prophecy.

32
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:03,031
An event first comes into existence
when there is a prophecy.

33
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,835
Who? Who makes the prophecies?

34
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:16,780
Throughout Tokyo today, the VTCZX road
traffic information transmission system...

35
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,616
...sent out incorrect information.

36
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:24,421
Especially at congested intersections,
traffic signals interfered with the...

37
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,626
...auto-drive program in cars and
trucks, sending them out of control.

38
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,929
There was a fatality
in Shibuya, Tokyo,

39
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:36,269
but the Information Ministry says
that the system is already back up,

40
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,900
and that such an accident
will never happen again.

41
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,041
Excuse me.

42
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,382
Huh?

43
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:23,910
<i>Uh...</i>

44
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,550
Mind if I hit on you?

45
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,170
<i>Oh, shit...</i>

46
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,330
Later!

47
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,836
H-Hey!

48
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,644
That little creep...

49
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:57,082
Damn it, this is gonna stain...

50
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,823
W-What the heck is this?

51
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,903
Some kind of bad joke...

52
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,873
What the hell...?

53
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:22,902
What's she doing?

54
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,539
Is she crazy?

55
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,225
Lain?

56
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,268
What's her problem?

57
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,505
The prophecy is
being fulfilled, Lain.

58
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,146
But then it's not a prophecy...

59
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,246
No, it is a prophecy.

60
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,782
History is not merely a linear
collection of points that...

61
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,729
...we pass through
on a timeline.

62
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,596
They are connected by a line.

63
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:54,731
No, perhaps it is more accurate to
say that they are made to connect.

64
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:59,275
By who? Who connects them?

65
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,497
Lain!

66
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,336
What did you do?

67
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,247
I had no idea. I guess
you're pretty good.

68
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:42,280
I didn't know you could pull off
a hacky stunt like that already.

69
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,144
What're you talking about?

70
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,281
Playing innocent again, huh?

71
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,356
I really don't...

72
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,892
You didn't do it, Lain?

73
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,293
Do what?

74
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,262
The Information Control Bureau
of the Information Ministry...

75
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,172
...began investigating yesterday's
information network abnormality,

76
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,302
stating that it was very
likely a deliberate act.

77
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,710
With the network now a lifeline for
not only the city, but for society,

78
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,485
such an act is tantamount to...

79
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,897
Your total is 948 yen.

80
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,972
Out of 948 yen.
Please, enjoy your meal.

81
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,500
Huh? There it is again.

82
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,869
Again?

83
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,338
What?

84
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,712
Spam. indiscriminate mail.

85
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,273
I'm really getting tired of this...

86
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,750
"Fulfill the prophecy," right?

87
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,983
Is it a declaration of
war by some cult group?

88
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:57,750
I asked some geeks I met on
the Wired about it a while ago.

89
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,453
They said it might be the Knights.

90
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,693
Knights? Who's that?

91
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,327
Some kind of super-hacker group.

92
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,204
But I thought hackers don't
usually work together.

93
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:16,207
True. But maybe this Knights
group really isn't a group at all.

94
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:22,442
They say they have a lot of power in the
Wired, and that they do a lot in secret.

95
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,853
So they're a secret society.

96
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,651
Geez, do they get their
kicks out of this stuff?

97
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,285
I'm not sure why...

98
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,351
Huh?

99
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:38,359
...but something tells me that they're
not in it for fun or for money.

100
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:59,780
It's reasonable to see the Wired as
an upper layer of the real world.

101
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:04,085
In other words, physical reality
is nothing but a hologram...

102
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,995
...of the information that
flows through the Wired.

103
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,698
Morn?

104
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,601
This is because the body -- the activity
of the human brain -- is merely...

105
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:20,304
...a physical phenomenon caused by
synapses delivering electrical impulses.

106
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,277
<i>I...</i>

107
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:29,742
The body exists only to
verify one's own existence.

108
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,222
Are you... Are you really my morn?

109
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,426
Are you?

110
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,064
Lain?

111
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,496
Huh?

112
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,673
Didn't I see you at Shibuya?

113
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,753
Forget it. It's nothing.

114
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,719
Thank you!

115
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,621
Hey, don't you think
he's pretty cute?

116
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,295
How did it go with him?

117
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,464
Come on, you can tell us!

118
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,198
W-What? What prophecy?!

119
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,139
What's going on?

120
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,977
I usually have dinner with
Morn and Dad about now...

121
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,242
Wha--

122
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,919
What's happening?

123
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,437
I-Is someone there?

124
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:55,085
Come on, I know you're there.

125
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,431
Are you my real dad?

126
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:55,702
It may be that what flows through the
Wired isn't merely electrical information.

127
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,575
Huh?

128
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,249
If we assume that it was the
development of electricity and phones...

129
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,310
...that brought about the
formation of the Wired,

130
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:09,554
then I have to wonder if another
world was created at that moment.

131
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,285
<i>Uh...</i>

132
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:16,265
Here in the real world,
God exists only as a concept.

133
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:21,362
But in the Wired, there may be
a sort of Deus-like embodiment.

134
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,168
God?

135
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:28,001
I don't know whether or not
it should be called a god.

136
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,637
But at the very least, I think
it has the same kind...

137
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,249
...of power that is
written of in myths.

138
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,953
I think I may have talked with God.

139
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:43,688
It's possible that the Deus of the
Wired may already have enough power...

140
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:47,788
...to affect the real
world in some instances.

141
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,260
Yes... In the form of prophecy.

142
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,063
Prophecy?

143
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,805
What's wrong?

144
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,539
It's nothing. Forget about it.

145
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,467
Who is it today?

146
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:39,358
I thought I was innocent,
but I'm being punished.

147
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:44,624
I didn't start this, but I
have to finish it somehow.

148
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:07,656
I can't say I didn't know about it,
but I don't remember taking part in it.

149
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:14,128
I get the feeling <i>my</i>
freedom cost me dearly,

150
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:21,406
but I don't remember
selling my soul cheaply.

151
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,778
Hey, hey!

152
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:29,241
Until I die and say goodbye...

153
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,782
Hey, hey!

154
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:39,160
... no one can catch me.

155
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:46,994
You probably don't know
the eternal outlaws...

156
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:52,401
...who wander the distant night.
