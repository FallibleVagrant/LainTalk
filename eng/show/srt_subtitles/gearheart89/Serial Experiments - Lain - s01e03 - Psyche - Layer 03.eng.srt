1
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:15,224
You've heard of a girl
named Lain, right?

2
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:19,461
Lain of the Wired.

3
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:38,977
Are your parents away on
vacation or something?

4
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,021
I called the number you gave
me, but no one answered.

5
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:47,784
<i>I'm not lying.</i>

6
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:51,794
No, I don't think you're
lying. I checked.

7
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:54,600
You're Lain lwakura, all right.

8
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,135
Your address and phone
number check out.

9
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:00,974
It's late, so I'm going to
have someone take you home.

10
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:03,739
But next time, I want
you to talk to me.

11
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:07,542
Keeping quiet is a bad idea,
even if you weren't involved.

12
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,641
For crying out loud...

13
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:13,551
Lain, I'm sorry!

14
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,446
This is all our fault.
Are you okay, Lain?

15
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,961
Are you all right, Lain?

16
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:26,026
<i>A...</i>

17
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:28,798
What is it, Lain?

18
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:33,033
A... ri... su.

19
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:37,709
Arisu! Come on!
We're going home.

20
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:40,378
Lain...

21
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:41,882
Arisu!

22
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:46,180
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Lain...

23
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:49,421
Tomorrow... Let's talk
tomorrow, okay?

24
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:50,752
I'm sorry!

25
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:54,488
So do you want to head home, too?

26
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:02,035
A... risu.

27
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,278
You have a key, right?

28
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:20,253
Yes.

29
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:33,478
Message...

30
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:39,525
There are no messages for Lain.

31
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:47,834
Good night, Navi.

32
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:50,230
Good night, Lain.

33
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:58,638
Don't you think it's embarrassing
for a junior high-schooler...

34
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:00,538
...to oversleep and
be late for school?

35
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:06,476
Morn... About last night...

36
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:09,908
Hm? What about it?

37
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,778
Never mind.

38
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:03,935
Lain.

39
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,636
Lain.

40
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,964
Lain.

41
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,709
It's me, Lain.
You can hear me, can't you?

42
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:18,412
Who's there?

43
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,349
You are not alone.

44
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,497
- 'Morning!
- Good morning!

45
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:34,058
Oh, my god!

46
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,194
Was he cute?

47
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,067
Yeah, they wouldn't
show his face on TV!

48
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:40,906
<i>Well...</i>

49
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,036
Oh, you were screaming the whole
time. Did you even see his face?

50
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:46,235
Well, yeah, but...

51
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:49,845
I was a little--

52
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:51,442
You were too scared to look.

53
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:53,845
Lain!

54
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:59,025
Lain, did you get in
trouble yesterday?

55
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:01,392
Come on, it wasn't really our fault.

56
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:02,895
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

57
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:06,161
Right, Arisu was closest to the guy!

58
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:09,327
So, was there blood
splattered all over?

59
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,667
Yeah...

60
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,331
Tell them!

61
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:14,272
- Come on!
- Arisu!

62
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,612
But that's not all.

63
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:27,477
If you look at the Psyche as a mere
processor, you lose sight of the whole.

64
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,288
As a multi-purpose
information terminal,

65
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:33,260
the Navi has come into wide use
even among grade-schoolers.

66
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:38,697
However, activity within the Wired
is currently limited by the machine.

67
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:44,000
The Psyche can dramatically increase
the performance of any Navi.

68
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:48,065
There was no reason for me to stay
in the real world any longer.

69
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:54,838
In the real world, it didn't
matter if I was there or not.

70
00:10:55,504 --> 00:11:02,547
When I realized that, I was no
longer afraid of losing my body.

71
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:05,523
Who is Lain?

72
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:06,790
Huh?

73
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,552
Who is Lain?

74
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:11,730
Who is Lain?

75
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,756
Who is Lain?

76
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,163
There's something wrong with us!

77
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:22,676
We saw someone die right
in front of us yesterday,

78
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:27,147
but we're acting like it's
something we saw in a movie.

79
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:33,946
I know we were there last night,
but it didn't seem real.

80
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:36,254
I guess it's like that for me, too.

81
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:40,922
I don't think you should take
it so seriously, Arisu.

82
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,592
No, that's not what I mean.

83
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,725
I'm saying it's strange that
we can't take it seriously.

84
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:48,130
Right, Lain?

85
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:50,464
Huh? What?

86
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:54,171
What's that, a love letter?

87
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:56,207
No way!

88
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:58,974
N-No! I don't think
it is, anyway...

89
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:00,571
Let us see! Let us see!

90
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,075
Come on, don't be stingy! Show us!

91
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,252
Stop that! It's mean!

92
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,548
A brown paper envelope, huh?

93
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,148
What's written on it?

94
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,390
- Huh?
- What the heck is this?

95
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:21,795
Talk about boring!

96
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:23,727
I knew it.

97
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,126
Psyche...

98
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:13,309
You've got it all wrong!
Somebody peeped my voice mail!

99
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:14,715
I can't believe it!

100
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:19,555
As the relevant clauses were
not in the resume we received,

101
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:24,256
we are currently discussing how to
handle it. As for your company...

102
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,891
I love kissing. Just kissing
is enough to make me happy.

103
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,572
You heard about that kid pulling
a stupid stunt on Accela, right?

104
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,608
Looks like the black market
supplier is freaking out.

105
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:38,873
You can't find it anywhere now.

106
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:44,048
Rumor has it that the Psyche chip is
mass-produced in factories in Taiwan.

107
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:48,187
Rumor also says that it was designed
by a group called the Knights.

108
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:53,358
But I'm not sure if these
"Knights" even exist.

109
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:56,854
In the Wired, there are a lot
of urban legends like that.

110
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:59,597
Dying feels so good!

111
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:02,995
I feel accelerated...

112
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:06,002
What the--? There's
someone in my room!

113
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:10,302
It's a little person like a kid
in a red and green striped shirt!

114
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:15,975
I can't move in my bed! It's
standing by my door, watching me!

115
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,882
Help me!

116
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,851
I have a picture of you
with your secret lover.

117
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,719
I just want to do business.
What do you say?

118
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:31,926
If you don't buy it, I'll leak this
image data to your company's server.

119
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:34,866
You'll be famous all
over the Wired.

120
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:40,569
Lain, why won't you come here?

121
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:51,917
Lain has new mail.

122
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:54,318
Navi--

123
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,220
How's it going, Lain?

124
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,058
Gotten used to your new Navi?

125
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:06,692
Something wrong?

126
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:13,534
Do you know what this is?

127
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:17,569
<i>No.</i>

128
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,904
I thought...

129
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:27,781
I thought you'd know, Dad.

130
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:30,455
I said I don't know.

131
00:16:19,194 --> 00:16:21,936
Come on, why not?

132
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,568
No... I can't...

133
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,444
Why not? I love you.

134
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,513
Lain!

135
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:41,920
Where you been lately?
I haven't seen you around.

136
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:44,729
<i>I...</i>

137
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:49,133
What the--? Damn, you're sure going
for the "little girl" look today...

138
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:55,736
Let's have another rave, okay?
I'll leave the planning to you.

139
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,252
- Why're you trying to act so tough?
- Excuse me.

140
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,985
Look who's talking!

141
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,922
Do you know what this is?

142
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,663
I-Is that a Psyche?!

143
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:26,806
Wha--

144
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,967
No way!

145
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,805
I've never seen one before!

146
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,611
W-Where did you buy it?

147
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:35,872
You know what this is?

148
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,617
What're you saying?

149
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:43,947
With that installed, I could get full
access to the Wired with even this!

150
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:46,916
How do you use it?

151
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:50,192
Talk about lame!
You don't even know that?

152
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,560
Can I buy it off you? Can I?

153
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:57,233
Moron! Like you could
buy something like that!

154
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:59,004
What kind of Navi do you have?

155
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:01,633
I'm not really sure.
It's a Tachibana.

156
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,106
Their newest model, I think.

157
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:06,738
Awesome!

158
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:11,113
Have you gotten inside it?

159
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:19,422
You in eighth grade? Ninth?

160
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:20,449
Eighth.

161
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:23,061
Then you've taken Basic
Information, right?

162
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:27,161
A Navi's basic motherboard
layout is in the textbook.

163
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:32,197
You connect it to the board,
opposite the main processor.

164
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:38,035
It intercepts the original data
and manipulates it on its own.

165
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:41,782
Using it is easier than
building a model kit.

166
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:45,676
You just need to watch out
for static electricity.

167
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:48,820
Oh. Thanks.

168
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:50,180
Hold it!

169
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:55,328
Information isn't free, not in
the Wired or in the real world.

170
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:58,291
How much you gonna
charge? How much?

171
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:01,294
<i>Uh...</i>

172
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:04,065
You're Lain, aren't you?

173
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:10,372
I saw you once. In the Wired.

174
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,779
You saw me? In the Wired?

175
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:18,348
You were totally different
then than you are now.

176
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:23,586
Most people take on a
personality in the Wired...

177
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:26,320
...that's different than what
they have in the real world,

178
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:28,924
but yours are total opposites.

179
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:30,294
No way!

180
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,224
You were here when that idiot
started shooting, too, weren't you?

181
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,494
What are you planning?

182
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,004
What... What should I do for you?

183
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:44,711
Go out on a date with me!

184
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:45,575
Moron.

185
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,775
But not like you are now.

186
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:52,016
I want the wild Lain.

187
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,117
I-I'm just kidding!

188
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:59,858
But if you feel like it sometime...

189
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,426
What're you talking about?!

190
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:02,761
<i>Hey...</i>

191
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:04,588
Forget about it! Let's go!

192
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,428
Sure!

193
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:07,861
What's so great about you?

194
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,989
Uh... Excuse me?

195
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:33,284
Are you here to see someone?

196
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,318
Who are you?

197
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:42,194
You never saw us.

198
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:44,960
W-What...? I'll call the police!

199
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:51,475
We're not here, you see.

200
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:57,944
<i>H-Hey...</i>

201
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:05,822
W-What the hell?

202
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:12,891
Morn, if they show up
again, call the cops!

203
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:15,331
Are you listening, Mom?

204
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:18,593
Damn it...

205
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,253
W-What're you doing, Lain?

206
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,830
What are you doing? Why are
you dressed like that?

207
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,370
Well, I heard that you have to
watch out for static electricity.

208
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:58,467
So I thought it'd probably be
safest if I took off my clothes.

209
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:02,879
A-Are you kidding?

210
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,045
Welcome home, sis!

211
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:37,073
I thought I was innocent,
but I'm being punished.

212
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:42,339
I didn't start this, but I
have to finish it somehow.

213
00:22:56,825 --> 00:23:05,370
I can't say I didn't know about it,
but I don't remember taking part in it.

214
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:11,841
I get the feeling <i>my</i>
freedom cost me dearly,

215
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:19,120
but I don't remember
selling my soul cheaply.

216
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:20,492
Hey, hey!

217
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:26,955
Until I die and say goodbye...

218
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,496
Hey, hey!

219
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:36,874
...no one will ever catch me.

220
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:44,709
You probably don't know
the eternal outlaws...

221
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:50,115
...who wander the distant night.
