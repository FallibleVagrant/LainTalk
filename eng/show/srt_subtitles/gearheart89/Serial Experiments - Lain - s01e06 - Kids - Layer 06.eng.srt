1
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:13,818
If people can connect to one another,
even the smallest voice will grow loud.

2
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:18,097
If people can connect to one another,
even their lives will become longer.

3
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:19,728
So...

4
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,446
Lain? I'm coming in.

5
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,773
Lain?

6
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:58,059
Thanks.

7
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:03,868
But I already verified that
register a long time ago.

8
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,476
That's hilarious!

9
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:13,136
Right...

10
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,712
I can't wait for the next-gen
protocol to come out.

11
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,015
When it does, I could...

12
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:25,890
Why are you guys so nice to me?

13
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:31,528
No, that's not what I think.

14
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,134
It's just a little strange.

15
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,767
I don't have many friends.

16
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:44,804
Thanks, Knights.

17
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:48,206
Yeah, right!

18
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:55,138
Connect

19
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:57,479
Hard at work studying, I see...

20
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:02,012
Listen, Lain...

21
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:04,651
It's like you're going back
to your old self lately.

22
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:08,326
Come hang out with
us again sometime.

23
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:13,192
Life's depressing when
you're alone all the time!

24
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,632
I know, but I'm not alone.

25
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,138
Huh? Who's with you, then?

26
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,305
Everybody comes to see me.

27
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:23,442
No, that's not right...

28
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,873
Maybe I go to see them.

29
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:28,781
What? The Wired, you mean?

30
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:33,010
A net-pal isn't the
same as a real friend.

31
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:36,083
Reika sure is an old fogey when
it comes to some things, huh?

32
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:37,816
Yeah, an old fogey!

33
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:40,320
So what if I am?

34
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,458
Anyway, Lain, what kind of sites
have you been hanging out at?

35
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:49,129
It's a secret.

36
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,164
Oh, acting high and mighty, huh?

37
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:54,106
Come on, tell us!

38
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,606
Hey, this'll look good!

39
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,204
No way! You should just give up!

40
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:02,182
I think this one's better.

41
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:04,811
No way! This one's better!
Right, Lain?

42
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:08,916
Hey, let's go to that store
we went to the other day.

43
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,516
They say they're having a 30-minute
all-you-can-eat ice cream special today.

44
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm hungry!

45
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,036
Huh?

46
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,139
What? What is it?

47
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:42,948
What's with that kid?

48
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:44,954
Beats me.

49
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:47,293
Come on, let's go!

50
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:48,795
Let's go, Lain.

51
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,504
Lain, what's--

52
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,542
No way!

53
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:42,180
What is that?

54
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,582
What the...?

55
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:48,719
Lain? That's--

56
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:23,353
You've certainly been
coming home early lately.

57
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:32,693
Now it's Lain who's
staying out late.

58
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:40,306
Do you think you'll get that
college recommendation?

59
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:44,900
Speak of the devil.

60
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,492
A strange phenomenon appeared
in the skies above Tokyo today.

61
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:06,022
People in the area who observed it
report being deeply unnerved by it.

62
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:09,036
Was this a malicious prank?

63
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:12,198
Was it merely a natural phenomenon,
or was it a deliberate act?

64
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:13,639
Hello, Navi.

65
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:15,404
Hello, Lain.

66
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,845
Connect to Wired.

67
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,693
So you're Lain, huh?

68
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:47,240
You're somethin' else, to be able to
translate your real world form...

69
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:49,743
...so well here into the Wired.

70
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,672
Stupid Cheshire Cat wannabe...

71
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:58,782
"Wannabe," nothing. At my user
level, this is the best I can do.

72
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,553
Most people can only manage ears.

73
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:04,818
I'm way better than them,
don't you think?

74
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:07,054
Shut your hole. Just give
me the information.

75
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:12,959
I helped Lain... This is gonna make
me a hero with the local users.

76
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,296
You're more noise than signal...

77
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:18,695
Tell me about the game that all the
grade-schoolers are playing.

78
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:22,401
A game? There's all
kinds of kids' games.

79
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,967
Moron.

80
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,138
You've got a hunch that
tells you it's a game?

81
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:29,513
To a kid, anything can be a game.

82
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:35,379
So you called up
the search result...

83
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:40,085
Now I get it. This man
might know the answer.

84
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:47,299
The child-killer scientist.

85
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:56,070
You live up to your reputation, Lain!
You searched him on your own!

86
00:11:56,098 --> 00:12:01,104
In the real world, he's just an old man
waiting to die in a private hospital ward.

87
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,150
I helped you.

88
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:11,385
A little.

89
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,761
Ask him about KIDS.

90
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:23,359
I already know. You're not much
of a guide, Cheshire Cat.

91
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:29,769
Now it's your turn,
Professor Hodgeson.

92
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,045
Tell me all about it.

93
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:14,587
You look very lifelike, young lady.

94
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,025
What's "KIDS"?

95
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:22,026
It's so peaceful here...

96
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:29,796
I want to relax here until my
body rots in the real world.

97
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:34,133
You know what's
happening, don't you?

98
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,507
What's "KIDS"?

99
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:42,208
Time passes so beautifully here...
And quietly, as if it will last forever.

100
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:46,817
Show me the experiment data from
15 years ago, Professor Hodgeson.

101
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:52,858
I never meant to put the
children in any danger.

102
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:59,323
I don't mean 15 years ago, I mean the
game that all the kids are playing now.

103
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:02,996
They're reproducing your
experiment, aren't they?

104
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:07,168
Somebody dug it out
of the trash can.

105
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:11,770
I thought I had erased all the data.

106
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:15,940
Tell me about the
Kensington Experiment.

107
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:26,617
Psi, parapsychological ability,
is present in most children,

108
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,755
although very faint in most.

109
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,732
It's nothing as outrageous as ESP.

110
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:42,935
It's just good intuition, or enough
physical ability to bend a coin.

111
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:46,246
What're these that are
attached to their heads?

112
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:50,808
We called them Outer Receptors.

113
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:53,580
That's what receives the Psi.

114
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,288
This is KIDS.

115
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:02,324
Individually, their Psi may be weak,

116
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:04,524
but if I could collect
their power...

117
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,696
What were you expecting?

118
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:08,861
Something beyond imagining.

119
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:11,462
That's what I wanted
to see, young lady.

120
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:15,505
What did you make them do?

121
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:19,936
Science isn't merely about
proving hypotheses.

122
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:22,241
That's what I believed.

123
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:24,312
That's not what I mean...!

124
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:29,882
So, you didn't give any
thought to the children.

125
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:31,858
<i>As you say.</i>

126
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:34,360
It was the KID System
that converted the weak...

127
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:37,592
...electromagnetic waves of the brain
received by the Outer Receptors,

128
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,568
...and enhanced the functions of
a specific area of the brain.

129
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,366
That is what KIDS really is.

130
00:15:55,871 --> 00:16:00,980
When the children's Psi was combined,
how much energy was generated?

131
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,453
Stop it...

132
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,991
Enough!

133
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:16,760
I smashed KIDS to pieces so
that it could never be rebuilt.

134
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:26,507
But its schematics found
their way onto the Wired...

135
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:29,878
...and eventually
coalesced somewhere.

136
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:33,677
Someone found them.

137
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,256
And updated it so that
it could manifest...

138
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,786
...phenomena without
Outer Receptors.

139
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:48,301
If it can influence these new children
to that extent as an emulation...

140
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,366
...I'm forced to
acknowledge their talent.

141
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:53,236
Is that all you can think about?

142
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,243
You don't care about the children?

143
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,305
No matter how much I punish myself,

144
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:03,783
those children won't
return to the real world.

145
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,448
And there's even less that I can
do about this current group.

146
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,187
Talk about self-centered.

147
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:14,917
So who's using it now?

148
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,429
Young lady...

149
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:22,095
All this talking has worn me out.

150
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,126
It was nice meeting you.

151
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:27,938
I don't know what you plan
to do in the Wired...

152
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,376
or what sort of being you're
trying to become,

153
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,746
but you're powerful.
Incredibly powerful.

154
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:42,011
If there really is a god here in
the Wired, you're a blessed child.

155
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,652
I... I'm not...

156
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:50,956
I wonder where the power of the
rogues that run the KIDS emulation...

157
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:54,598
...and this other kind
of power come from?

158
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:57,365
Rogues?

159
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:02,300
If you'll excuse me, then...

160
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,368
I'm a little tired.

161
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:09,147
My body's time has run out.

162
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:14,950
My wish has come true.

163
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,142
Knights...

164
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,215
Shut up!

165
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:05,796
Who are you people? Why did
you try to tell me all this?

166
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:13,810
Was I just your toy?
Is this all a game?

167
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:17,111
What do you want to
use the children for?

168
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:19,047
Are you just doing it for kicks?

169
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,987
You'll do anything if you can do
it and if you think it'll be fun!

170
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:32,397
Then you're just
a bunch of losers!

171
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:42,698
Aren't you going to speak up?
Isn't anybody going to answer?

172
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:30,281
Them...!

173
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,557
Now I get it!

174
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:50,266
You!

175
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,236
You're Knights, right?

176
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:01,855
You are, aren't you?
You're Knights, right?

177
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:06,949
Please get down.

178
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:13,091
W-What the hell was that?

179
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,663
The coolant system in your room.

180
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,335
They must've planted a parasite
bomb in your coolant system.

181
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,045
It almost sounds like you're
saying you didn't do it.

182
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:32,410
It wasn't us.

183
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,049
Who was it, then?

184
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:40,986
Who did it?!

185
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:47,827
The Knights.

186
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:37,507
I thought I was innocent,
but I'm being punished.

187
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:42,773
I didn't start this, but I
have to finish it somehow.

188
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:05,804
I can't say I didn't know about it,
but I don't remember taking part in it.

189
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:12,275
I get the feeling <i>my</i>
freedom cost me dearly,

190
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:19,554
but I don't remember
selling my soul cheaply.

191
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:20,925
Hey, hey!

192
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:27,389
Until I die and say goodbye...

193
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,930
Hey, hey!

194
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:37,308
... no one can catch me.

195
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:45,143
You probably don't know
the eternal outlaws...

196
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,549
...who wander the distant night.
